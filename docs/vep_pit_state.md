# Publishing Point-in-Time State

In this article

After you have launched a publishing operation to a PostgreSQL server (as described in [Publishing to Specified Server](vep_ptsr.md)), you can quickly publish another point-in-time state of the PostgreSQL instance to the same server.

To publish a PostgreSQL instance as of the point-in-time state, use the Publish wizard.

1. [Launch the Publish wizard](vep_lpw.md).
2. [Specify a restore point](vep_srp.md).
