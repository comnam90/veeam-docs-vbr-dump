# Step 2. Specify Storage Name or Address and Storage Role

In this article

At the Name step of the wizard, specify the storage system name and description:

1. In the DNS name or IP address field, specify a DNS name or IPv4 address of the storage system.
2. In the Description field, provide a description for future reference. The default description contains information about the user who added the storage system, date and time when the storage system was added.

Only NAS backup jobs are allowed to access this storage system, so the NAS filer check box is selected automatically in the Role section.
