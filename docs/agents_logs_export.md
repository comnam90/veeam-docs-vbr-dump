# Exporting Logs from Veeam Backup & Replication Console

In this article

Veeam Backup & Replication stores log files in different locations. To learn more, see [Managing Logs](logging.md).

| NOTE |
| You cannot export Veeam Agent for Mac logs from the Veeam Backup & Replication console. To collect Veeam Agent for Mac logs, [export them directly from the Veeam Agent computer](agents_logging.md). |

To export all log files to one location, use the Export Logs wizard.

1. [Launch the Export Logs wizard](agents_launch_export_logs_wizard.md).
2. [Select a virtual infrastructure scope](agents_export_logs_servers.md).
3. [Specify a time interval](agents_export_logs_date.md).
4. [Specify a destination folder](agents_export_logs_destination.md).
5. [Review the results](agents_export_logs_results.md).

| TIP |
| If you do not have access to the Veeam Backup & Replication console and you cannot use the built-in log export, export logs manually as described in [this Veeam KB article](https://www.veeam.com/kb1832). |
