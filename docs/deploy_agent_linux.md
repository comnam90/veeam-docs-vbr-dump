# Deploying Veeam Agent for Linux

In this article

To deploy Veeam Agent for Linux using setup files generated by Veeam Backup & Replication, perform the following operations:

1. [Installation](#install)
2. [Configuration](#configure)

|  |
| --- |
| NOTE |
| You can also generate setup files for nosnap versions of Veeam Agent for Linux (including Veeam Agent for Linux on Power). |

| TIP |
| You can also find detailed instructions on the Veeam Agent deployment in the readme file that is available among the setup files generated by Veeam Backup & Replication. |

Installation

To install Veeam Agent for Linux and all the required components, do the following:

1. Upload Veeam Agent setup files on the computer you want to protect.

Keep in mind that you must use Veeam Agent setup files that are generated by Veeam Backup & Replication after the protection group for pre-installed Veeam Agents is created. To learn more, see [Specifying Packages](protection_group_packages.md).

1. Navigate to the directory where you have saved setup files and install Veeam Agent.

Configuration

To configure Veeam Agent for Linux, you must apply connection settings from the configuration file that you obtained when the protection group for pre-installed Veeam Agents was created. To do this, run the following command from the directory where Veeam Agent setup files are located:

|  |
| --- |
| veeamconfig mode setVBRsettings --cfg <protection\_group\_name>.xml |

where <protection\_group\_name> is a name of the protection group for pre-installed Veeam Agents. Alternatively, you can specify the full path to the configuration file passed with the --cfg option.

Consider that the connection between Veeam Backup & Replication and Veeam Agent is not persistent. Veeam Agent synchronizes with Veeam Backup & Replication every 6 hours. After you apply new backup policy settings in the Veeam Backup & Replication console, Veeam Agent will get these settings during the next synchronization.

To synchronize Veeam Agent immediately, run the following command on the Veeam Agent computer:

|  |
| --- |
| veeamconfig mode syncnow |
