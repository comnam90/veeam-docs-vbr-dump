| TIP |
| You can also find detailed instructions on the Veeam Agent deployment in the readme file that is available among the setup files generated by Veeam Backup & Replication. |

Installation

Initial Veeam Agent Deployment

To deploy a new installation of Veeam Agent for Linux and all the required components on a computer that belongs to a protection group for pre-installed Veeam Agents, do the following:

1. Upload Veeam Agent setup files to the computer you want to protect.

You must use the Veeam Agent setup files that were generated by Veeam Backup & Replication when the protection group for pre-installed Veeam Agents was created.

1. Navigate to the directory where you have saved the setup files and install Veeam Agent as described in the [Installing Veeam Agent for Linux in Offline Mode](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/agentforlinux/userguide/installation_offline.html?ver=13) section of the Veeam Agent for Linux User Guide.

Veeam Agent Upgrade

After upgrade of Veeam Backup & Replication, Veeam Agent for Linux on the computers in protection groups for pre-installed Veeam Agents may become outdated. To manually upgrade Veeam Agent for Linux on such computer, do the following:

1. Regenerate Veeam Agent setup files [using the Edit Protection Group wizard](agents_protection_group_edit.md).

To learn more about generating setup files, see [Specifying Packages](protection_group_packages.md).

1. Upload the generated Veeam Agent setup files to the computer you want to protect.
2. Navigate to the directory where you have saved the setup files and install Veeam Agent as described in the [Upgrading Veeam Agent for Linux in Offline Mode](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/agentforlinux/userguide/upgrade_process_offline.html?ver=13) section of the Veeam Agent for Linux User Guide.

| TIP |
| If you upgraded Veeam Backup & Replication to the latest version and the protected computer has access to the internet or a local mirror of the [Veeam software repository](https://repository.veeam.com/backup/linux/agent-13/), you can upgrade Veeam Agent for Linux using the standard procedure described in the [Upgrading Veeam Agent for Linux](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/agentforlinux/userguide/upgrade_process.html?ver=13) section of the Veeam Agent for Linux User Guide.  After installation, you must apply the configuration settings of the protection group to Veeam Agent. For more information, see [Configuration](#configure). |

Configuration

To configure Veeam Agent for Linux, you must apply connection settings from the configuration file that you obtained when the protection group for pre-installed Veeam Agents was created. To do this, run the following command from the directory where Veeam Agent setup files are located:

|  |
| --- |
| veeamconfig mode setVBRsettings --cfg <protection\_group\_name>.xml |

where <protection\_group\_name> is a name of the protection group for pre-installed Veeam Agents. Alternatively, you can specify the full path to the configuration file passed with the --cfg option.

Note that connection between Veeam Backup & Replication and Veeam Agent is not persistent. Veeam Agent synchronizes with Veeam Backup & Replication every 6 hours. After you apply new backup policy settings in the Veeam Backup & Replication console, Veeam Agent will get these settings during the next synchronization.

To synchronize Veeam Agent immediately, run the following command on the Veeam Agent computer:

| veeamconfig mode syncnow |
