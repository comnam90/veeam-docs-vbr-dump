# Creating Vaults


Created vaults are shown under the Vaults node. If you have no vaults created, the Vaults node will not be shown.

To create a new vault, use the New Media Vault wizard. This section will guide you through all steps of the wizard and provide explanation on available options.

To add a vault, follow the next steps:

1. [Launch the New Media Vault wizard](launch_new_media_vault_wizard.md).
2. [Specify a media vault name](specify_media_vault_name.md).
3. [Finish working with the wizard](finish_working_with_vault_wizard.md).
