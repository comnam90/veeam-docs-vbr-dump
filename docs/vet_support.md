If you have any questions or issues with Veeam Explorer for Microsoft Teams, you can visit [Veeam R&D Forums](https://forums.veeam.com) or submit a support case on the [Veeam Customer Support Portal](https://www.veeam.com/support.html).

Before you submit a support ticket, make sure that comprehensive information is provided to the Veeam Support Team. To do this, take the following steps:

1. Perform the problematic operation with the extended logging mode enabled. For more information, see [Advanced Settings](vet_logging.md).
2. Use the Support Information wizard as described in the [Collecting Log Files for Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 Components](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbo365/guide/vbo_exporting_logs.html?ver=80) section of the Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 User Guide.
