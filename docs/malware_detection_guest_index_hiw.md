# How Guest Indexing Data Scan Works

In this article

A guest indexing data scan is started in the following situations:

* When the backup job with guest file system indexing enabled is complete and indexing data is saved on the backup server in the VBRCatalog folder (for Veeam Backup & Replication on Microsoft Windows) or /var/lib/veeam/catalog/ directory (for Veeam Backup & Replication on Linux).
* If the Veeam Data Analyzer Service gets new indexing data after the service starts.
* If you import backups with the Import guest file system index data to the catalog check box selected.

If malware activity is detected, the Veeam Data Analyzer Service will create a malware detection event and mark objects as Suspicious. This can trigger a proactive signature-based scan, if you have them enabled. For more information, see [Signature Detection](malware_detection_signature_detection.md).

| Note |
| If you upgrade to Veeam Backup & Replication 13.0.1 from versions older than 12.1, old indexing data will not be scanned. |

If you disable guest indexing data scan for a period of time and enable it again, indexing data created during this time will be scanned in the following cases:

* When the next backup job with guest file system indexing enabled is complete.
* When the Veeam Data Analyzer Service restarts.

Note that this process may increase the load on the backup server, depending on the size of the indexing data.
