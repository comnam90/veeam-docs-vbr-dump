# Configuring Veeam Plug-In for Proxmox VE


To start working with Veeam Plug-in for Proxmox VE, perform a number of steps for its configuration:

1. [Configure backup repositories](pve_configure_repository.md) where Veeam Backup & Replication will store backups of Proxmox VE VMs.
2. [Connect to Proxmox VE servers](pve_sever_add.md) that administer Proxmox VE resources you want to protect.
3. [Deploy workers](pve_workers.md) that will transfer backup traffic.
4. [[Optional] Configure email settings and notifications](pve_general_settings.md).
