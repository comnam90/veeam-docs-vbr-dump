# Migrating VMs Using Web UI

In this article

Quick Migration is not job-driven: it cannot be saved as a job or scheduled to run later. Veeam Backup & Replication will start relocating VMs immediately after you finish working with the Quick Migration wizard.

Before you start Quick Migration, [check prerequisites](quick_migration_before_you_begin_hv.md). Then use the Quick Migration wizard to migrate VMs.

1. [Launch the wizard](quick_migration_launch_web.md).
2. [Specify a destination](quick_migration_destination_web.md).
3. [Specify datastores and disk types](quick_migration_datastore_web.md).
4. [Select infrastructure components for data transfer](quick_migration_infrastructure_web.md).
5. [Finish working with the wizard](quick_migration_summary_web.md).
