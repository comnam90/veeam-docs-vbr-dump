# Step 5. Select Restore Mode

In this article

The Restore Mode step is required if you use the All Time option at the [Select Files and Folders to Restore](restore_files_folders_backup_browser.md) step and the selected folders have more than one restore point.

Choose to what point you want to restore files and folders:

* To restore the folder to the latest available restore point, select Latest state.
* To select a specific restore point, select Earlier restore point.

Choosing this option will open the [Restore Point](restore_files_folders_restore_point.md) step.
