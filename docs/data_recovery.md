# Data Recovery for VMware vSphere

* [VM recovery](vm_restores.md) — to restore entire VMs to different data protection environments: to VMware vSphere, Hyper-V, Amazon EC2 and so on.
* [Disk recovery](disk_restores.md) — to recover and export disks.
* [Item recovery](item_recovery.md) — to recover VM files, guest OS files and folders, and application items.

Veeam Backup & Replication also provides data recovery methods available for all platforms. For more information, see [Platform-Independent Data Recovery](data_recovery_all.md).
