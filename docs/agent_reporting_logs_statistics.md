# Viewing SQL Server Transaction Log Backup Statistics

In this article

If you configure a backup job or backup policy to back up Microsoft SQL Server transaction logs, you can view statistics about the SQL Server transaction log backup job session performed on protected computers. For more information about backup of Microsoft SQL Server transaction logs, see [Microsoft SQL Server Transaction Log Settings](agent_job_vss_sql.md).

For Veeam Agent backup jobs and policies, Veeam Backup & Replication displays statistics in the similar way as for backup jobs for VM data backup. To learn more, see [Transaction Log Backup Statistics](sql_backup_stats.md).

To view Veeam Agent backup job or backup policy statistics:

1. Open the Home view.
2. In the inventory pane, click the Jobs node.
3. In the working area, select the necessary backup job or backup policy and click Statistics > SQL Server log backup on the ribbon. Alternatively, you can right-click the backup job or backup policy and select Statistics > SQL Server log backup.
