# Group Managed Service Accounts


You can add a credentials record for a Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) that you plan to use to run guest processing tasks. Note that before you add a record you should check requirements and limitations and perform actions described in section [Using Group Managed Service Accounts](using_gmsa.md).

You can create a new credentials record with the gMSA in one of the following ways:

* [Create a managed service account using the Veeam Backup & Replication console](credentials_manager_gmsa_console.md)
* [Create a managed service account using the Veeam Backup & Replication web UI](credentials_manager_gmsa_web.md)
