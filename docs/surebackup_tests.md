# Backup Recovery Verification Tests


To verify machines with a SureBackup job in Full recoverability testing mode, you can instruct Veeam Backup & Replication to run the following backup recovery verification tests:

* [Predefined tests](predefined_tests.md)
* [Backup File Validation](surebackup_backup_files_valdiation.md)
* [Custom verification scripts](custom_verification_scripts.md)

When running a SureBackup job in Backup verification and content scan only mode, you can only instruct Veeam Backup & Replication to perform backup integrity check.
