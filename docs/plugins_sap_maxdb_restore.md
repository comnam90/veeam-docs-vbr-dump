# Performing Restore


With the configured Veeam Plug-In you can restore SAP MaxDB databases from the backups that reside in the Veeam backup repository. All restore operations are performed on the Veeam Plug-In side.

For details about SAP MaxDB database restore, see [SAP MaxDB documentation](https://maxdb.sap.com/doc/7_7/d4/fba2eae7ba441c88771db88768d99e/frameset.htm).

| Tip |
| * This guide provides examples for Database Manager CLI. Apart from Database Manager CLI, you can perform backup operations using MaxDB Studio. * You can restore SAP MaxDB databases from backup copies created for Veeam Plug-In for SAP MaxDB backups. The procedure of database restore from a backup copy is the same as database restore to another server. For more information, see [Restore to Another Server](plugins_sap_maxdb_restore_to_another.md). |
