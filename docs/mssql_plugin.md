# Veeam Plug-In for Microsoft SQL Server

In this article

Veeam Plug-In for Microsoft SQL Server is a backup tool for Microsoft SQL Server databases. Veeam Plug-In integrates with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and transfers database backups and transaction log backups to backup repositories configured in Veeam Backup & Replication.

Database administrators can use Veeam Plug-In for Microsoft SQL Server to create native application-level backups of Microsoft SQL Server data. Compared to image-level backups created by Veeam Backup & Replication, Veeam Plug-In offers more flexible scenarios for database backup. In particular, Veeam Plug-In users can back up and restore individual Microsoft SQL Server databases, as well as configure independent backup schedule for full, differential and log backups using the SQL Agent Job functionality of Microsoft SQL Server.
