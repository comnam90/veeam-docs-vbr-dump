# Publishing with Veeam Explorer for MongoDB

In this article

You can publish MongoDB instances from backups created with the MongoDB Backup feature of Veeam Backup & Replication. Then, you can perform required operations using MongoDB tools such as MongoDB Compass or  restore collections managed by the published instance using Veeam Explorer for MongoDB.

To publish MongoDB data, Veeam Backup & Replication uses Veeam Explorer for MongoDB for restore operations. Before you perform instance publishing, review considerations and limitations for Veeam Explorer for MongoDB listed in [Considerations and Limitations](vemdb_considerations.md).

To learn more about restore operations, see [Publishing Instance](vemdb_rs_publish_instance.md).
