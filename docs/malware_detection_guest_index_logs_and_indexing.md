# Logs and Indexing Data Retention

In this article

You can view the log of malware activity in the Event Details window. For more details, see [Viewing Malware Detection Events](malware_detection_view_events.md).

Information about malware activity is also stored in malware detection logs. The default path is:

* C:\ProgramData\Veeam\Backup\Malware\_Detection\_Logs for Veeam Backup & Replication on Microsoft Windows.
* /var/log/VeeamBackup/Malware\_Detection\_Logs for Veeam Backup & Replication on Linux.

Logs older than 7 days are automatically archived on Mondays.

By default, guest indexing data is stored for 14 days. If Veeam Backup & Replication is connected to Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager the length of the retention period will change depending on how Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager is deployed:

* If Veeam Backup & Replication is installed on the same server as Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager, the guest index retention period will depend on your Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager settings. For more information, see [Configuring Retention Settings for Index and History](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/em/configuring_retention_settings.html?ver=13).
* If Veeam Backup & Replication and Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager are installed on separate servers, all guest indexing data will be stored:

* On the Veeam Backup & Replication server — in the VBRCatalog folder (for Veeam Backup & Replication on Microsoft Windows) or in the /var/lib/veeam/catalog/ directory (for Veeam Backup & Replication on Linux) for 14 days.
* On the Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager server — in the VBRCatalog folder (for Veeam Backup & Replication on Microsoft Windows) or in the /var/lib/veeam/catalog/ directory (for Veeam Backup & Replication on Linux) for the retention period specified in your Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager settings.
