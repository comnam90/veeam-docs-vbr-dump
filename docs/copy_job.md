# Copying VMs


With VM copy jobs you can create a fully-functional copy of a VM and store this copy in the backup repository or storage device. VM copying may be helpful if you want to move your datacenter to another location, archive a VM before decommissioning and so on.

To create a VM copy, you must configure a VM copy job. One job can be used to process one VM or more VMs.

You can configure a job and start it immediately or save the job to start it later. Jobs can be started manually or scheduled to run automatically at a specific time.

Before you create a VM copy job, [check prerequisites](vm_copy_before_you_begin.md). Then use the New VM Copy Job wizard to configure a VM copy job.

1. [Launch the New Virtual Machine Copy Job wizard](vm_copy_launch.md).
2. [Specify a job name and description](vm_copy_name.md).
3. [Select VMs to copy](vm_copy_vms.md).
4. [Exclude objects from the VM copy job](vm_copy_exclude.md).
5. [Specify a copy destination](vm_copy_destination.md).
6. [Specify guest processing settings](vm_copy_vss.md).
7. [Define a job schedule](vm_copy_schedule.md).
8. [Finish working with the wizard](vm_copy_finish.md).
