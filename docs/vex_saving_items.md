# Saving Microsoft Exchange Items


Veeam Explorer for Microsoft Exchange allows you to save any item as Microsoft Exchange Mail Document (.msg) files.

1-Click Save

To save your Exchange data, do the following:

1. In the navigation pane, select a folder containing required items.
2. In the preview pane, select items that you want to save and do one of the following:

* On the Items tab, click Save Items > Save to <folder\_name>.
* Right-click the selection and select Save to <folder\_name>.

Use the search field to find particular items.

A <folder\_name> name depends on the latest location that was used when saving items.
