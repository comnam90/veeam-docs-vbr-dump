| TIP |
| You can also find detailed instructions on the Veeam Agent deployment in the readme.txt file that is available among the setup files generated by Veeam Backup & Replication. |

Installation

To install Veeam Agent for Unix and all the required components, do the following:

1. Upload the installation archive to a directory that can be accessed from the computer where you want to install the product and extract setup files from this archive.

Keep in mind that you must use the Veeam Agent installation archive that is generated by Veeam Backup & Replication after the protection group for pre-installed Veeam Agents is created. To learn more, see [Specifying Packages](protection_group_packages.md).

1. Navigate to the directory where you have extracted setup files and install Veeam Agent. This procedure is similar to the default installation of the Veeam Agent for Unix.

To learn more, see the following sections:

* For Veeam Agent for Oracle Solaris, see the [Installing Veeam Agent](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/agentforsolaris/userguide/install_solaris.html?ver=13) section in the Veeam Agent for Oracle Solaris User Guide.
* For Veeam Agent for IBM AIX, see the [Installing Veeam Agent](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/agentforaix/userguide/install_aix_rpm.html?ver=13) section in the Veeam Agent for IBM AIX User Guide.

Configuration

To configure Veeam Agent for Unix, you must apply connection settings from the configuration file that you obtained when the protection group for pre-installed Veeam Agents was created. To do this, run the following command from the folder where Veeam Agent setup files are located:

|  |
| --- |
| veeamconfig mode setVBRsettings --cfg <protection\_group\_name>.xml |

where <protection\_group\_name> is a name of the protection group for pre-installed Veeam Agents. Alternatively, you can specify the full path to the configuration file passed with the --cfg option.

Consider that the connection between Veeam Backup & Replication and Veeam Agent is not persistent. Veeam Agent synchronizes with the Veeam backup server every 6 hours. After you apply the connection settings, Veeam Agent will use them to connect to backup server during the next synchronization.

To synchronize Veeam Agent immediately, run the following command on the Veeam Agent computer:

| veeamconfig mode syncnow |
