# Credentials Manager


You can use the Credentials Manager to create and maintain a list of credentials records that you plan to use to connect to components in the backup infrastructure.

The Credentials Manager lets you create the following types of credentials records:

* [Standard account](credentials_manager_windows.md)
* [Group Managed Service Accounts](credentials_manager_gmsa.md)
* [SSH credentials](credentials_manager_linux.md)
* [SSH private keys](credentials_manager_linux_pubkey.md)
* [Kasten Authentication Tokens](credentials_manager_kasten.md)

Credentials stored in the configuration database are encrypted with specific data protection mechanisms. For more information, see [How Database Data Encryption Works](encryption_database_hiw.md).
