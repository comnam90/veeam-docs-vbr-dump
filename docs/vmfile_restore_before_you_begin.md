# Before You Begin


Before you restore VM files, check the following prerequisites:

* You can restore VM files from a backup that has at least one successfully created restore point.
* The server on which you plan to save restored VM files must be added to the backup infrastructure.
* You cannot select the backup server as the target for recovery due to security reasons.
