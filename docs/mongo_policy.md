# Working with Application Backup Policy

In this article

To back up MongoDB items, you must create an application backup policy and add your MongoDB replica sets to the backup scope. For details, see [Creating Application Backup Policy](mongo_policy_create.md).

After you create a MongoDB backup job, you can back up MongoDB items with this backup job. For details, see [Starting and Stopping Application Backup Policy](mongo_policy_manage_start_stop.md#start). Veeam Backup & Replication backs up MongoDB items according to backup settings that you specify. You can specify what nodes to back up and processing settings for the backed-up data.

Apart from running, you can perform a certain set of other operations with an application backup job. For details, see [Managing Application Backup Policy](mongo_policy_manage.md).
