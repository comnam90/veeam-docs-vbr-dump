# Restore from Backup Copy


You can restore IBM Db2 databases from backup copies of backups created with Veeam Plug-In for IBM Db2. The procedure of database restore from a backup copy is the same as database restore to another server. For more information, see [Restore to Another Server](db2_restore_to_another.md).
