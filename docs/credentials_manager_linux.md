# SSH Credentials

In this article

By default, the Credentials Manager includes a system SSH credentials record for the helper appliance. You can also create a credentials record to connect to a Linux server or a Linux-based VM.

You can create a new credentials record with a user name and password for a Linux server in one of the following ways:

* [Create an SSH credentials record using the Veeam Backup & Replication console](credentials_manager_linux_console.md)
* [Create an SSH credentials record using the Veeam Backup & Replication web UI](credentials_manager_linux_web.md)
