# Mail Settings


Veeam Explorer for Microsoft Exchange allows you to send Exchange items that are located in a backup by email and deliver [export reports](vex_receiving_export_reports.md).

Veeam Explorer for Microsoft Exchange sends email messages on behalf of your Google or Microsoft 365 account using [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749), or you can specify connection settings of an SMTP server that uses basic authentication.

For more information, see the following sections:

* [SMTP Server with Basic Authentication](vex_conf_smtp_settings.md)
* [Google Account](vex_google_account.md)
* [Microsoft 365 Account](vex_m365_account.md)
