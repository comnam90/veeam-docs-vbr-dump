# Step 4. Add New vCenter


This is an optional step which is required if the new vCenter has not been added to the backup infrastructure.

To add the new vCenter, see [Adding VMware vSphere Servers](add_vmware_server.md) section of the guide and complete the New VMware Server wizard.

After that, ensure that you have migrated all VMs for which you want to resolve MORef-ID misalignment. For more information, see [Quick Migration](quick_migration.md).
