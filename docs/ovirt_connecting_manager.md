# Connecting oVirt KVM Manager


The oVirt KVM Manager allows the backup server to access oVirt KVM resources such as VMs, hosts, clusters, storage domains and networks. After you add the oVirt KVM Manager to the backup infrastructure, you will be able to deploy workers and to manage data protection tasks for oVirt VMs using the Veeam Backup & Replication console.
