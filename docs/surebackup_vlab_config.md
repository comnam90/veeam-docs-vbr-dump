# Virtual Lab Configuration

* [Basic single-host virtual lab](surebackup_basic_vlab.md)
* [Advanced single-host virtual lab](surebackup_advanced_vlab.md)

| Note |
| You can also verify VM backups in Advanced Multi-Host virtual labs with DVS. This scenario can be helpful if you want to test VM backups and VM replicas in the same virtual lab or want to add verified VM backups and replicas to the same SureBackup job. |
