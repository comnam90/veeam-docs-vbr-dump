# What You Do Next


After you create a protection group, Veeam Backup & Replication automatically rescans computers that you added to the created protection group and deploys Veeam Plug-Ins on these computers. To learn more, see [Rescan Job](rescan_job.md).

After the rescan process completes and Veeam Plug-Ins are successfully deployed on target computers, you can create the application backup policy. Application backup policies allow you to protect computers in the protection group. To learn more, see [Working with Application Policies](application_policies.md).
