If you want to use the Veeam Plug-In for Kasten solution, you must have the following types of product editions installed:

* Veeam Backup & Replication server requires either the Rental license or the Enterprise Plus product edition. For more information, see [Veeam Licensing Policy](https://www.veeam.com/licensing-policy.html).
* Veeam Kasten requires a valid license to protect Kubernetes applications with Veeam Backup & Replication. For more information, see the [Veeam Kasten product page](https://www.kasten.io/product/#k10-editions).

| Note |
| Veeam licenses Veeam Backup & Replication in two ways: per instance and per socket. However, backups exported by the Veeam Kasten policy do not consume any instances or sockets. For more information on licensing, see the [Licensing](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/licensing.html?ver=120#socket-licensing) section in the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide. |
