| Backups exported by Veeam Kasten to Veeam Backup & Replication 11 version will be available in your backup infrastructure after you upgrade to Veeam Backup & Replication version 12. However, you must [add the Veeam Kasten instance](adding_k10.md) to the backup infrastructure, otherwise the Veeam Plug-In for Kasten data protection and data recovery functionality will not be available. |
