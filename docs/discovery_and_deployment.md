# Computer Discovery and Veeam Plug-In Deployment

In this article

Veeam Backup & Replication supports automated and manual deployment of Veeam Plug-Ins on computers in your infrastructure.

You can deploy Veeam Plug-In for Oracle RMAN, Veeam Plug-In for SAP HANA, Veeam Plug-In for Microsoft SQL Server, and Veeam Plug-In for SAP on Oracle from the Veeam Backup & Replication console. To deploy Veeam Plug-Ins, Veeam Backup & Replication needs to discover computers whose data you want to back up. To enable discovery, you organize your computers into one or more protection groups. Protection group settings define what computers Veeam Backup & Replication will discover and how the discovery process will run. To learn more, see [Protection Groups](protection_group_hiw.md).

You can also disable automated Veeam Plug-In installation when [configuring a protection group](protection_group_options.md). In this case, you will need to use the Veeam Backup & Replication console to install Veeam Plug-In on every computer included in the protection group. To learn more, see [Installing Plug-In](protected_computers_install.md).
