# Before You Begin

In this article

Before you start restoring backups from tape to repository, consider the following:

* [Item restore](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/em/em_backup_restore_app_items.html) in the Enterprise Manager from backups restored from tapes to the repository is not supported.
* Restoring machine backups from tapes to object storage repositories is not supported.
* [For backup to tape jobs from the HPE StoreOnce appliance] Restoring backups from tapes to a different HPE StoreOnce appliance is not supported if the source HPE StoreOnce appliance uses the variable block size and the target HPE StoreOnce appliance uses the fixed block size.
