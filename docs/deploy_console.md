# Veeam Backup & Replication Console Installation


The Veeam Backup & Replication console is a client-side component that provides access to the backup server. Install a Veeam Backup & Replication console on a dedicated Windows server to access the backup server remotely. When a backup server is installed on a Windows machine, the Veeam Backup & Replication console is installed on the same machine automatically. You do not need to install it manually.

However, in addition to the default console, you can install the Veeam Backup & Replication console on a dedicated machine to access the backup server remotely. You can install as many remote consoles as you need. For more information, see [Backup & Replication Console](backup_console.md).
