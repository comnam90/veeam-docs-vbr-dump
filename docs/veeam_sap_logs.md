# Logs and Support

In this article

If you have any questions or issues with Veeam Plug-In for SAP HANA or Veeam Backup & Replication, you can search for a resolution on [Veeam Community Forums](https://forums.veeam.com/) or submit a support case on the [Veeam Customer Support Portal](https://www.veeam.com/support.html).

When you submit a support case, we recommend you attach necessary logs related to Veeam Plug-In operations.

To learn how to collect logs, see [this Veeam KB](https://www.veeam.com/kb2872).
