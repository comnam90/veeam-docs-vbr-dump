# Retention of IBM Db2 Backups

In this article

In the main scenario, when using Veeam Plug-In for IBM Db2, you must configure the retention policy using native IBM Db2 tools. For details, see [Deleting Backups Using IBM Db2 Tools](db2_retention_remove_from_machine.md).

Alternatively, you can manually delete backups from a backup repository using the Veeam Backup & Replication console and enable the force deletion functionality of Veeam Plug-In. For details, see the following sections:

* [Deleting Backups Manually Using Veeam Backup & Replication Console](db2_retention_remove_from_vbr.md)
* [Configuring Force Deletion of Backups](db2_retention_force_delete.md)
