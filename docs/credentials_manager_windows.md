# Standard Accounts


By default, the Credentials Manager includes the following system standard credentials records:

* A credentials record for the provider-side network extension appliance
* A credentials record for the tenant-side network extension appliance
* A credentials record for the Microsoft Azure helper appliance (former Azure proxy)

You can create a credentials record for an account that you plan to use to connect to a Microsoft Windows server, vCenter server, ESXi host, Hyper-V server, a VM running Microsoft Windows OS, a storage system and others.

You can create a new standard account in one of the following ways:

* [Create a standard account using the Veeam Backup & Replication console](credentials_manager_windows_console.md)
* [Create a standard account using the Veeam Backup & Replication web UI](credentials_manager_windows_web.md)
