# Migrating File Share to Production


|  |
| --- |
| Note |
| Migration to production is supported for backups of SMB file shares only. |

After you recover an SMB file share as described in section [Performing Instant File Share Recovery](performing_instant_file_share_recovery.md), you can update the content of the mounted file share. After that, you can keep all the changes by migrating the mounted file share to production.

To migrate the mounted file share to production use the Migrate to Production wizard.

1. [Launch the Migrate to Production wizard](migrate_share_to_production_launch.md).
2. [Define a destination for the migration](migrate_share_to_production_destination.md).
3. [Specify additional restore options](migrate_share_to_production_restore_options.md).
4. [Specify file share switchover options](migrate_share_to_production_restore_switchover.md).
5. [Finish working with the wizard](migrate_share_to_production_summary.md).
