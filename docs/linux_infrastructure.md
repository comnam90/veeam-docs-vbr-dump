# Deploying Linux Infrastructure Components


You can prepare a Linux machine as a backup infrastructure component in one of the following ways:

* Configure the machine with Veeam Infrastructure Appliance based on Rocky Linux distribution. This requires the JeOS ISO file and is the recommended option. For more information, see [Installing Veeam Infrastructure Appliance with ISO](linux_infrastructure_appliance_install.md).
* Configure the machine manually with a supported operating system. For more information, see the [system requirements](system_requirements.md) for specific backup infrastructure components.

For information on adding Linux components to your backup infrastructure, see [Adding Veeam Infrastructure Appliance](adding_via.md) and [Adding Linux Servers](add_linux_server.md).
