# Veeam Agent Integration (Storage Systems)

In this article

Veeam Backup & Replication allows you to integrate your storage systems with Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows installed on computers in your infrastructure. For more information, see [Backup from Storage Snapshots](agents_storage_systems.md).

To start working with storage systems, you must properly configure the backup infrastructure. For more information, see [Infrastructure Overview](storage_infrastructure.md). After that, you can use storage snapshots for data protection and disaster recovery operations.

For requirements and limitations for Veeam Agent integration, see [Considerations and Limitations](agents_storage_systems.md#limits) .

For information on how backups from storage snapshots are created, see [Storage Snapshots Support](agents_storage_systems.md#start).
