# Exporting Logs

In this article

If you want to submit a support ticket, we recommend that you include log files to ensure that overall and comprehensive information is provided to Veeam Customer Support. Veeam Agent logs for computers of all protection group types are stored on the Veeam backup server. If you back up computers with pre-installed Veeam Agents, you can also collect logs directly from the protected computer.

To learn more, see the following subsections:

* [Exporting Logs from Veeam Backup & Replication Console](agents_logs_export.md) — if you want to collect the logs from the Veeam backup server.
* [Exporting Logs from Veeam Agent Computers](agents_logging.md) — if you want to collect the logs from a Veeam Agent computer with pre-installed Veeam Agent.
