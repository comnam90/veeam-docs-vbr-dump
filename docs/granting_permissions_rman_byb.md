# Before You Begin


Before you create a user group that will have access to the plug-in configuration file, consider the following:

* To perform this procedure, the OS user account must have root privileges (for Linux/UNIX) or local administrator privileges (for Microsoft Windows).
* After a user is added to the group, they must log out, then log in to the system again to activate the group permissions.
* Add only trusted users to the group.

| The users that configure the plug-in and start the RMAN client must be added to the group. |
