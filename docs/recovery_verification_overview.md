| Important |
| The availability of the recovery verification feature depends on the license you use. For more details about licensing support, see [Veeam Data Platform Feature Comparison](https://www.veeam.com/veeam_data_platform_feature_comparison_ds.pdf).  If you use the Standard edition, you can manually verify VM backups with Instant Recovery. For more information, see [Manual Recovery Verification](surebackup_manual.md). |
