# Before You Begin

In this article

* The Veeam Backup & Replication license must have a sufficient number of instances to process computers that you plan to add to the application backup policy.
* The backup repository where you plan to store backup files must have enough free space.
* A protection groups for MongoDB that you want to add to the policy must be configured in advance. For details, see [Creating Protection Group for MongoDB](protection_group_create_mongo.md).
