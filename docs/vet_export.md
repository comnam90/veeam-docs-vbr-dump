# Data Export

In this article

You can use Veeam Explorer for Microsoft Teams to export posts published in a team channel to a file of the HTML format. You can export all posts of a channel, export posts created during a specified time period or export individual posts.

The export operation can be useful, for example, if you want to restore posts of a team channel to another channel. To do this, you can export posts to an HTML file, publish this file in Microsoft SharePoint and publish a link to this file in a custom tab of the necessary channel.

Before exporting data, read the [Considerations and Limitations](vet_considerations.md) section.
