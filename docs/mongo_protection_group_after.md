# What You Do Next


After you create a protection group, Veeam Backup & Replication automatically rescans computers that you added to the created protection group and deploys Veeam components on these computers. To learn more, see [Rescan Job](mongo_rescan_job.md).

After the rescan process completes and Veeam components are successfully deployed on target computers, you can create the application backup policy. To learn more, see [Creating Application Backup Policy](mongo_policy_create.md).
