# Known Suspicious Files and Extensions


To detect suspicious files and extensions commonly used by malware, the Veeam Data Analyzer Service compares the guest indexing data of a restore point with the SuspiciousFiles.xml file. If files have extensions or names that match any in the SuspiciousFiles.xml file, a malware detection event is created.

|  |
| --- |
| Note |
| Do not edit the SuspiciousFiles.xml file directly. You can customize the list of suspicious files and extensions in the following ways:   * [Add custom suspicious files and extensions](#addingsuspiciousfiles). * [Exclude suspicious files and extensions](#excludingsuspiciousfiles). * [Exclude files and folders](#excludingsuspiciousfolders). * [Export and import custom lists](#exportingandimportinglists). |

Adding Custom Suspicious Files and Extensions

To add custom files and extensions that should be marked as suspicious, perform the following steps:

1. From the [main menu](vbr_ui.md), select Malware Detection > File Detection and click Suspicious files to monitor.
2. Click Add next to the Suspicious files field.
3. Specify a file extension or a file name with or without extension. You can also use \* and ? wildcard characters. For example:

|  |
| --- |
| bot.txt  bot  b?t  \*.avi |

|  |
| --- |
| Note |
| Malware detection scan is case-insensitive. You do not need to add extensions or file names with different cases, for example, bot and Bot. |

1. Click OK.

Excluding Suspicious Files and Extensions

To exclude a file name or file extension listed in the SuspiciousFiles.xml file and ignore it during the scan, do the following:

1. From the [main menu](vbr_ui.md), select Malware Detection > File Detection and click Suspicious files to monitor.
2. Click Add > Extension next to the Trusted objects field.
3. Specify a file name or file extension as it is listed in the SuspiciousFiles.xml file (the FileMask tag). For example:

|  |
| --- |
| \*.cryptoboss |

1. Click OK.

|  |

| Note |
| You can also add files and extensions to the trusted list from the Event Details window. For more information, see [Viewing Malware Detection Events](malware_detection_view_events.md). |

Excluding Files and Folders

To ignore a specific file or a folder during the scan, do the following:

1. From the [main menu](vbr_ui.md), select Malware Detection > File Detection and click Suspicious files to monitor.
2. Click Add > Path next to the Trusted objects field.
3. Specify a path to the file or folder. For example:

|  |
| --- |
| C:\Users\user1\New Folder\  C:\Users\user1\file.txt  /home/user1/Folder/  /home/user1/file.md |

1. Click OK.

|  |
| --- |
| Note |
| Consider the following:   * A path to a folder must include the last slash (" /" or "\" ) symbol. * A Linux path must start with a slash ("/") symbol. * A Windows path must start with a drive letter. For example, "C:\". * UNC paths are not supported. * Wildcard characters are not supported. * Excluding files and folders is applied only to the following malware activity types:  * Known suspicious files and extensions * Renamed files * Deleted files |

| Includes | Child element of the RansomwareExclusions element. Contains custom files and extensions that must be marked as suspicious. Can be empty. |

| Item (IgnoredPaths) | Child element of the IgnoredPaths element. Each Item contains a path to the specific file or folder that must be ignored.  The element also has a specific Type attribute. Possible values:   * Absolute — Absolute paths   Consider the following:   * A path to the folder must include the last slash (" /" or "\" ) symbol.  * File and folder names can contain spaces.  * Paths must not contain the following characters: <, >, ", |,\*,?. * Use &amp; to escape an ampersand (&). |
