# Step 8. Define Job Schedule


At the Schedule step of the wizard, you can define a schedule for the job to run on a regular basis. The schedule settings are different for regular backup to tape jobs and GFS tape jobs:

* [Schedule for Backup to Tape Job](backup_to_tape_simple_schedule.md)
* [Schedule for GFS Tape Job](backup_to_tape_gfs_schedule.md)
