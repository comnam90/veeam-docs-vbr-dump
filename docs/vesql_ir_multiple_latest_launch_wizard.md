| The name of the instant recovery option depends on the restore point you select during the [application item restore](restore_veeam_explorers.md) process in the Veeam Backup & Replication console.   * If you select the most recent available restore point, the option name is displayed as Instant recovery of the latest state to <original\_location>. * If you select any other restore point, the option name is displayed as Instant recovery of the state of <point\_in\_time> to <original\_location>. |
