# Starting PowerShell Sessions


To run Veeam Explorers cmdlets in the PowerShell console, make sure one of the following components is installed on the machine:

* Veeam backup server
* Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 server
* Veeam Backup & Replication console
* Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 PowerShell toolkit

You can also run some Veeam Explorers modules specific to Veeam Backup & Replication on [Linux machines](from_windows_powershell.md#linux_machines).

You can start the PowerShell session either from [Veeam products](from_console.md) or the [PowerShell console](from_windows_powershell.md).
