# Using Get-Help


Using Get-Help

The Get-Help cmdlet is a Microsoft cmdlet. You can use this cmdlet to get information on Microsoft cmdlets, as well as on cmdlets added with Veeam Explorers PowerShell modules.

To get full details about the necessary cmdlet, run the Get-Help <cmdletname> -full command from your PowerShell console. The Get-Help command will return a whole set of parameters that are available for the cmdlet and an input type for each parameter.
