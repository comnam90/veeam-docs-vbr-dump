# Tape Device Support


Veeam provides native tape support that is fully integrated into Veeam Backup & Replication. You can administer all operations on tapes from your Veeam Backup & Replication console.

Long-term archiving and compliance are listed as primary reasons for using tape. Tape appears to be one of the most widely used media for offsite backup. Using backup to tape, you can implement the ‘3-2-1’ backup approach (3 copies, 2 types of media, 1 offsite location), considered the best practice for data protection and disaster recovery. Veeam Backup & Replication offers support for tape devices and allows you to archive your data to tape and restore it from tape whenever needed.

Storing data to tapes provides you with the same data managing options as disk repositories. In particular, you can store full and incremental backups, apply user-defined retention settings to the archived data, select restore points and so on. Compared to disk storage, tape archive requires more time to retrieve files for restore if the tapes are stored offsite.
