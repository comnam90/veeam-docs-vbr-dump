# Step 11. Synchronize Backups and Tape Libraries

In this article

After the configuration database is restored, Veeam Backup & Replication can perform a synchronization operation for backups and replicas created on the backup server and tape libraries connected to the backup server.

* The synchronization operation for backups and replicas is performed if you are restoring a database from a backup created by Veeam Backup & Replication in the Restore mode and you have selected to restore data from the backup and replica catalog.
* The synchronization operation for tape libraries is performed if you are restoring a database from a backup created by Veeam Backup & Replication in the Restore mode and you have selected to restore data from the backup and replica catalog.

Wait for the synchronization operation to complete.
