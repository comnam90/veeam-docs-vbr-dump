# Restoring Application Items


You can use Veeam Explorers to restore application items from backups created using Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows and Veeam Agent for Linux. Veeam Backup & Replication lets you restore items and objects from the following applications:

From backups created with Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows

* Microsoft Active Directory
* Microsoft Exchange
* Microsoft SharePoint
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Oracle

From backups created with Veeam Agent for Linux

* Oracle
* PostgreSQL

The procedure of application item restore from a Veeam Agent backup does not differ from the same procedure for a VM backup. To learn more, see [Application Item Restore](restore_veeam_explorers.md).
