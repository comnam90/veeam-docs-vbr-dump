# Restore from Backup Copy


You can restore Oracle databases from backup copies created for Veeam Plug-In for Oracle RMAN backups. The procedure of database restore from a backup copy is the same as database restore to another server. For more information, see [Restore to Another Server](restore_other_server_rman.md).
