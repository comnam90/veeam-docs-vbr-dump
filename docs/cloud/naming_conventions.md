# Naming Conventions


Do not use Microsoft Windows reserved names for names of backup repositories, jobs, tenants and other objects created in Veeam Backup & Replication: CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8 and LPT9. If you use a reserved name, Veeam Backup & Replication may not work as expected. To learn more about naming conventions in Microsoft Windows, see [Microsoft documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396#naming_conventions).
