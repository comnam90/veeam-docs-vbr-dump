# Managing License Usage Reports


On the first day of the month, Veeam Backup & Replication generates a license usage report. The report is based on the current number of used points.

The SP can perform the following actions with the license usage report:

* [For automatic reporting] [Submit the license usage report to Veeam](sp_license_usage_submit.md)
* [Review the license usage report](sp_license_usage_review.md)
* [Save the license usage report](sp_license_usage_save.md)
* [Adjust the number of processed VMs in the report](sp_license_usage_adjust.md)
* [Postpone the review of the report](sp_license_usage_postpone.md)

The SP can also generate the report manually to view information about current license usage. To learn more, see [Generating License Usage Report](sp_license_usage_generate.md).
