# Managing SP Backup Server


Veeam Backup & Replication allows the SP to inform tenants about currently running maintenance of the SP backup infrastructure. As part of the maintenance scenario, the SP can perform the following operations on the SP backup server:

* [Switch the SP backup server to the Maintenance mode](cc_maintenance_mode_enable.md).
* [Create a custom Maintenance mode notification](cc_maintenance_message.md).
