# Managing Tenant Cloud Failover Plans


A cloud failover plan created by a tenant is stored in the database on the SP Veeam Backup & Replication server. The SP can manage tenant cloud failover plans from the Veeam Backup & Replication console on the SP side. This may be useful in case the tenant Veeam backup server is unavailable along with the production site after a disaster.

The SP can perform the following operations with a tenant cloud failover plan:

* [Run a cloud failover plan](cloud_failover_plan_start_sp.md).

* [Test a cloud failover plan](cloud_failover_plan_test_sp.md).
* [Retry a cloud failover plan](cloud_failover_plan_retry_sp.md).
* [Undo failover by a cloud failover plan](cloud_failover_plan_undo_sp.md).
* [Edit cloud failover plan settings](editing_cloud_failover_plan_se.md).
* [Perform permanent failover](performing_permanent_failover_sp.md).
