# Using Remote Access Console


The SP can remotely access the tenant backup server to manage Veeam Backup & Replication deployed on the tenant side. The SP can connect to a tenant backup server in one of the following ways:

* [Connect to a tenant backup server with the Remote Access Console](cc_remote_console.md).
* [Connect to a tenant backup server over the Remote Desktop Protocol](cc_remote_desktop.md).

As part of the remote tenant backup server management process, the SP may also need to perform the following administration tasks:

* [Set up Veeam Backup & Replication to accept connections from a remotely deployed Remote Access Console (over the internet)](cc_remote_access.md).
* [Adjust remote desktop connection settings](cc_remote_desktop_config.md).
