To find an SP:

3. Click Find Service Provider in the working area. A [page of the Veeam website](https://www.veeam.com/find-a-veeam-cloud-provider.html?ad=bkp-prod-v9&id=02067762) will open in your web browser. Use the filter on the webpage to find the necessary SP by the type of provided cloud services, SP datacenter location or virtualization platform.
