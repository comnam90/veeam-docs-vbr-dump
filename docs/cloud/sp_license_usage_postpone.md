# Postponing License Usage Report Review


You can postpone the license usage report review. When you postpone the report review, Veeam Backup & Replication will close the Monthly Usage Report notification window. Veeam Backup & Replication will display this notification every time you open the Veeam Backup & Replication console until the report is sent to Veeam.

For automatic license usage reporting, if you do not send the report to Veeam within 10 days, Veeam Backup & Replication will send the report automatically on the third day of the month. If you perform manual reporting, you must send the report before the day defined by the agreement with Veeam or your Aggregator (if any is involved). The default day is the tenth day of the month.

To postpone the report review:

* [For automatic reporting] In the notification window informing that the report is generated, click Postpone.
* [For manual reporting] In the notification window informing that the report is generated, click Postpone Review.
