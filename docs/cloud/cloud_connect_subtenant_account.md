To work with the cloud repository, a subtenant uses the subtenant account. Veeam Backup & Replication offers two types of subtenant accounts:

* [Standalone subtenant account](#standalone) — accounts of this type are used to back up data to the cloud repository with Veeam Agent operating in the standalone mode.
* [Managed subtenant account](#managed) — accounts of this type are used in the Veeam Agent management scenario.

Standalone Subtenant Account

In the scenario where users on the tenant side back up data to the cloud repository with Veeam Agent operating in the standalone mode, the tenant or SP must create subtenant accounts. The number of subtenant accounts created per tenant is not limited in Veeam Backup & Replication.

Typically, the tenant is the party responsible for creating and managing subtenant accounts. However, the SP can perform the same operations with subtenant accounts as the tenant. This allows the SP to create, edit or delete subtenant accounts upon tenant requests, for example, if the tenant has no access to the Veeam Backup & Replication console.

Veeam Backup & Replication saves information about subtenant accounts in the Veeam Backup & Replication database. Every time the tenant or SP performs an operation with the subtenant account, Veeam Backup & Replication updates the subtenant data and replicates this data between the tenant side and SP side.

Managed Subtenant Account

In the Veeam Agent management scenario where Veeam Agent is deployed and managed remotely from Veeam Backup & Replication, the tenant or SP does not need to create subtenant accounts to back up Veeam Agent machines to the cloud repository. In this scenario, Veeam Backup & Replication creates subtenant accounts automatically. Such accounts are considered as managed subtenant accounts.

Veeam Backup & Replication creates a managed subtenant account for each machine added to a backup policy. A machine uses this account to connect to the SP during the backup process.

Veeam Backup & Replication automatically generates names, passwords and descriptions for managed subtenant accounts. In contrast to standalone subtenant accounts, passwords for managed subtenant accounts are saved in the Veeam backup database on the tenant backup server only. Passwords for managed subtenant accounts are not passed to the SP side.

The tenant or SP can manually edit a managed subtenant account, if necessary. The following operations are available:

* Change the password for the subtenant account. This operation is required if you want to perform bare-metal recovery from a Veeam Agent backup created by a backup policy in a cloud repository. Keep in mind that this operation is available only for the tenant in the tenant Veeam backup console. The SP cannot change the password for a managed subtenant account.
* Limit subtenant quota. By default, Veeam Backup & Replication creates managed subtenant accounts with unlimited subtenant quota. The tenant or SP can limit storage quotas individually for each created subtenant account.
* Disable and enable the subtenant account. By default, Veeam Backup & Replication creates managed subtenant accounts in the enabled state. After you disable a managed subtenant account, Veeam Agent managed by Veeam Backup & Replication will not be able to connect to the SP and back up data to the cloud repository.
* Specify a custom description for the managed subtenant account instead of the default description generated by Veeam Backup & Replication.
