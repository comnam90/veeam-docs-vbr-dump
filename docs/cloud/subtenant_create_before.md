In this article

Before you add a new subtenant account, check the following prerequisites:

* You must be connected to the SP whose cloud repository you want to expose to subtenants. When you create a subtenant account, you can allocate storage quota only on those cloud repositories that are provided to your tenant account by the SP.
* You can allocate only one storage quota per subtenant account. To provide a user with multiple quotas on the same or different cloud repositories, you must create different subtenant accounts for the same user.
