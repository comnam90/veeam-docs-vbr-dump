VMware Cloud Director backup is practically the same as a regular VM backup. The VMware Cloud Director backup job aggregates main settings for the backup task and defines when, what, how and where to back up.

You can perform the VMware Cloud Director backup job for single VMs and for VM containers, that, in terms of VMware Cloud Director, are the following:

* vApp
* Organization VDC
* Organization
* VMware Cloud Director instance

Just like a regular backup job, the VMware Cloud Director backup job can be scheduled or run manually.
