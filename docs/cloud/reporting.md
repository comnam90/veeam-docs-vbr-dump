The SP can monitor status of the Veeam Cloud Connect infrastructure and performance of tenant jobs targeted at cloud resources of the SP:

* To track the Veeam Cloud connect infrastructure status, the SP can view the Veeam Cloud Connect report. The SP can use the Veeam Backup & Replication console to generate the ad-hoc report at any time the SP needs. The SP can also set up Veeam Backup & Replication to send the Veeam Cloud Connect report daily by email. To learn more, see [Viewing Veeam Cloud Connect Report](cc_report.md).
* To track performance of tenant jobs, the SP can view detailed statistics in the job session window. To learn more, see [Viewing Tenant Job Statistics](cc_report_jobs.md).
