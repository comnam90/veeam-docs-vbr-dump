Tenants can perform the following VM replication and data recovery tasks against the cloud host:

* Replication
* Failover:

* Full site failover (failover by cloud failover plan)
* Partial site failover

* Failback

* Restore from replica

* VM guest OS files restore (Microsoft Windows FS only. Multi-OS restore is not supported.)
* Application items restore

As well as snapshot-based replicas, the tenant can create CDP replicas on the cloud host. To learn more, see [Continuous Data Protection (CDP) with Veeam Cloud Connect](cloud_connect_cdp.md).
