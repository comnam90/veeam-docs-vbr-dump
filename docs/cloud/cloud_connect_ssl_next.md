# What You Do Next


After installing a TLS certificate on the SP Veeam backup server, the SP can send the copied information about the TLS certificate so that tenants can save the certificate thumbprint for TLS certificate verification.

This step can be performed in Veeam Cloud Connect infrastructure that uses a self-signed TLS certificate. If you use a TLS certificate signed by a CA, skip this step. Signed TLS certificates are trusted without additional verification.
