The Guide for Tenants is intended for tenants who want to store their data in the cloud repository or replicate their VMs to the cloud host configured with the help of the Veeam Cloud Connect functionality in Veeam Backup & Replication. The guide describes main steps that tenants must take to set up Veeam Cloud Connect infrastructure components and work with cloud repositories and cloud hosts exposed by SPs.
