# Performing Full Site Failover


You can preset scenarios for one-click failover for a group of interdependent production VMs to the cloud host — full site failover. To do this, you must create a cloud failover plan. You must create the cloud failover plan in advance, for example, right after you created VM replicas on a cloud host. In case the whole production site goes offline for any reason, you can run the cloud failover plan to perform full site failover.
