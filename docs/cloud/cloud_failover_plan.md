# Creating Cloud Failover Plans


If you have a number of VMs running interdependent applications, you need to fail over them one by one, as a group. To do this automatically, you can prepare a cloud failover plan.

Before creating a cloud failover plan, [check prerequisites](cloud_failover_plan_byb.md). Then use the Cloud Failover Plan wizard to create a cloud failover plan.

1. [Launch the Cloud Failover Plan wizard](cloud_failover_plan_launch.md).
2. [Specify the failover plan name and description](cloud_failover_plan_name.md).
3. [Select virtual machines](cloud_failover_plan_vms.md).
4. [Specify default gateways](cloud_failover_plan_gateways.md).
5. [Specify public IP addressing rules](cloud_failover_plan_public_ip.md).
6. [Finish working with the wizard](cloud_failover_plan_summary.md).
