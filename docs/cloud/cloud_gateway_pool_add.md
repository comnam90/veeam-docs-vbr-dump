# Configuring Cloud Gateway Pools


The procedure of cloud gateway pool configuration is performed by the SP on the SP Veeam backup server.

You can organize cloud gateways deployed in the Veeam Cloud Connect infrastructure into cloud gateway pools. Usage of cloud gateway pools allows you to assign dedicated cloud gateways to specific tenants.

You can configure one or more cloud gateway pools in the Veeam Cloud Connect infrastructure. Each cloud gateway pool can contain one or more cloud gateways.

Before deploying a cloud gateway, [check prerequisites](cloud_gateway_pool_before.md). Then use the New Gateway Pool wizard to add a cloud gateway.

1. [Launch the New Gateway Pool wizard](cloud_gateway_pool_launch.md).
2. [Specify cloud gateway pool name and description](cloud_gateway_pool_name.md).
3. [Choose cloud gateways](cloud_gateway_pool_select.md).
4. [Finish working with the wizard](cloud_gateway_pool_finish.md).
