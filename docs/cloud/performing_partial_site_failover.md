You can quickly recover one or several corrupted VMs by failing over to their replicas on the cloud host.

For regular, snapshot-based replicas on the cloud host, the partial site failover operation is similar to the regular failover for the off-site replication scenario. To learn more, see the following sections of the Veeam Backup & Replication documentation:

* [Failover](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/userguide/failover.html?ver=13) section in the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide for VMware vSphere
* [Failover](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/hyperv/failover.html?ver=120) section in the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide for Microsoft Hyper-V

For CDP replicas on the cloud host, the partial site failover operation is similar to failover for regular CDP replicas. To learn more, see the [Failover](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/cdp_failover.html?ver=120) section in the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide.
