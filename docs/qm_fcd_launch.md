# Step 1. Launch FCD Quick Migration Wizard

In this article

To launch the FCD Quick Migration wizard

1. Open the Home view.
2. In the inventory pane, select the Instant Recovery node.
3. In the working area, right-click the VM to which disks were recovered and select Migrate to production. Veeam Backup & Replication will launch the [FCD Quick Migration](migration_job_fcd.md) wizard.

After you finish working with the wizard, Veeam Backup & Replication migrates the disks with all changes made after the disk recovery and before its migration.
