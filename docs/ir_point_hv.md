# Step 3. Select Restore Points


By default, Veeam Backup & Replication uses the latest valid restore points to recover the workloads. You can recover a workload to an earlier state, if necessary. If you have chosen to recover multiple workloads, you can select a restore point for each workload in the list.

To select a restore point:

1. In the Machines to restore list, select a workload.
2. Click Point on the right.
3. In the Restore Points window, select a restore point from which you want to recover the workload.
