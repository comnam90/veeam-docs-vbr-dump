# Step 2. Select Workloads


At the Machines step of the wizard, you can modify a list of workloads from which you fail over. To add workloads, click Add > From infrastructure if you want to add workloads from the virtual infrastructure, or Add > From replicas if you want to add workloads from existing replicas. Then select the necessary workloads.
