# Exporting Logs


You can use log files to submit a support ticket. It is recommended that you send all log files when submitting a support ticket to ensure that overall and comprehensive information is provided to Veeam Support Team. You can collect the logs in one of the following ways:

* [Exporting Logs Using Console](exporting_logs_console.md)
* [Downloading Logs Using Web UI](exporting_logs_web.md)
