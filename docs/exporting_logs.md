# Exporting Logs

In this article

You can use log files to submit a support ticket. It is recommended that you send all log files when submitting a support ticket to ensure that overall and comprehensive information is provided to Veeam Support Team.

To aggregate all log files in the same location, use the Export Logs wizard.

1. [Launch the Export Logs wizard](launch_export_logs_wizard.md).
2. [Select virtual infrastructure scope](export_logs_servers.md).
3. [Specify the time interval](export_logs_date.md).
4. [Specify a destination folder](export_logs_destination.md).
5. [Review the results](export_logs_results.md).

| If you do not have access to the Veeam Backup & Replication console and you cannot use the built-in log export, export logs manually as described in [this Veeam KB article](https://www.veeam.com/kb1832). |
