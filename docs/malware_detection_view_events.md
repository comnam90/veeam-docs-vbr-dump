To view detailed information related to a specific malware detection event, do one of the following:

* In the working area, double-click the malware detection event.
* Select the malware detection event and click Details on the ribbon. Alternatively, right-click the event and select Details.

Events created during the guest indexing data scan include additional information:

* Paths to the log files that contain the list of detected suspicious files and extensions.
* Paths to the log files that contain the list of multiple files deleted by malware.

In the Event Details window, you can add detected suspicious files and extensions to the trusted list and ignore them during the next guest indexing data scans. To do this, click Exclude these extensions from monitoring. For more information on how to manage the list of suspicious files and extensions, see [Known Suspicious Files and Extensions](malware_detection_guest_index_suspicious_files.md).
