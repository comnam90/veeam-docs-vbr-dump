# Overview


Starting from version 12.2, Veeam Backup & Replication comes with a plug-in that extends the solution functionality and allows you to add Nutanix AHV servers to the backup infrastructure, as well as to manage data protection and recovery operations for Nutanix AHV workloads from a single console.

| Note |
| In versions prior to 12.2, the default Veeam Backup & Replication installation did not provide the functionality to protect Nutanix AHV workloads — to unlock this functionality, Veeam Plug-in for Nutanix AHV had to be installed manually. Moreover, Veeam used to release separate updates for the plug-in, which resulted in the backup server version being different from the plug-in version. For more information on the version compatibility, see [System Requirements](ahv_system_requirements.md#compatibility).  The current version of Veeam Backup & Replication is 13.0.1.1071; the current version of Veeam Plug-in for Nutanix AHV is 13.9.0.212. |
