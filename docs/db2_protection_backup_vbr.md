# Managing Backups in Veeam Backup & Replication

In this article

In the Veeam Backup & Replication console, backups created by Veeam Plug-Ins are displayed in the Backups node of the Home view. In the working area, backups created by Veeam Plug-In for IBM Db2 are listed under the IBM Db2 node.

You can use the Veeam Backup & Replication console to perform the following operations with Veeam Plug-In backups:

* [Create a recovery token for a backup](db2_protection_backup_vbr_token.md)
* [Remove a backup from configuration](db2_protection_backup_vbr_remove.md)
* [Delete a backup from the backup repository](db2_protection_backup_vbr_delete.md)
