# Instant File Share Recovery

In this article

The instant file share recovery feature works in 2 modes depending on the type of the file share:

* For NFS file shares, you can use this feature to publish a point-in-time file share state to enable users to instantly access all protected files in the read-only mode.
* For SMB file shares, you can use this feature to publish a point-in-time file share state to enable users to add, update, remove files in the mounted file share. The updated file share may be then migrated to the production server.
