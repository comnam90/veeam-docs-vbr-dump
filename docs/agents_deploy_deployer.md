# Deploying Veeam Agent Using Veeam Deployment Kit


You have an option to install Veeam Agent on Microsoft Windows and Linux computers using certificate-based authentication instead of credentials. To do so, you must download Veeam Deployment Kit on the computer, install the required packages and then add the computer to a protection group of the [Individual computers](protection_group_individual.md) type.

Deployment scenario depends on the Veeam Agent you work with:

* [Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows](agents_deployer_vaw.md)
* [Veeam Agent for Linux](agents_deployer_val.md)
