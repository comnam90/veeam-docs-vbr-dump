# Veeam Plug-In for IBM Db2


Veeam Plug-In for IBM Db2 is a backup tool for IBM Db2 databases. Veeam Plug-In integrates with IBM Db2 tools and transfers database and log backups to repositories connected to Veeam Backup & Replication.

Database administrators can use Veeam Plug-In for IBM Db2 to create native application-level backups of IBM Db2 server data. Compared to image-level backups created by Veeam Backup & Replication or Veeam Agent, Veeam Plug-In offers more flexible scenarios for database backup. In particular, Veeam Plug-In users can back up and restore individual IBM Db2 databases, as well as configure independent backup schedule for full, incremental and log backups using built-in tools of IBM Db2 servers.
