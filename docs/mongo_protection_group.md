# Working with Protection Group


MongoDB Backup is a feature of Veeam Backup & Replication. This guide gives instructions on how to deploy Veeam components assuming that you already have deployed Veeam Backup & Replication and configured a backup repository. To learn how to deploy Veeam Backup & Replication, see the [Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide](https://www.veeam.com/documentation-guides-datasheets.html) for your platform.

To use MongoDB Backup, you must create a protection group dedicated for MongoDB. For details, see [Creating Protection Group for MongoDB](protection_group_create_mongo.md).

If you want to use Veeam Deployment Kit to connect to the protected computers, before configuring a protection group, you must install Veeam components on the computer. For details, see [Deploying Plug-In Using Veeam Deployment Kit](protection_group_deployer_service.md).
