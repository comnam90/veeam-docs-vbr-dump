# Backup and Restore of Unix Computers


|  |
| --- |
| NOTE |
| In Veeam documentation, Veeam Agent for IBM AIX and Veeam Agent for Oracle Solaris are collectively referred to as Veeam Agent for Unix. IBM AIX and Oracle Solaris servers are collectively referred to as Unix servers or Unix machines. |

To back up data of Unix servers, you can use Veeam Agent for Unix in combination with Veeam Backup & Replication. In this scenario, some Veeam Agent features differ from the same features in Veeam Agent operating in the standalone mode. This section provides description for such features in the Veeam Agent management scenario.
