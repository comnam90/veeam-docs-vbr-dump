# Retention of SAP on Oracle Backups

In this article

To set an automatic removal of old backups, you can use the retention policy of Veeam Plug-In for SAP on Oracle. The --set-force-delete command of Veeam Plug-In automatically deletes backup files which are older than specified number of days. For details, see [Configuring Retention Policy for Backups](garbage_collector_sap_orcl.md).

Also, you can manually delete backups from a backup repository using the Veeam Backup & Replication console. For details, see [Deleting Backups Manually Using Veeam Backup & Replication Console](manual_remove.md).
