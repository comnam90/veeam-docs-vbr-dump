# Installing Veeam Plug-In

In this article

You can install Veeam Plug-In on a specific protected computer in the inventory. This operation may be required, for example, if you want to test the installation process before allowing Veeam Backup & Replication to deploy Veeam Plug-In to all computers included in the protection group.

Before you install Veeam Plug-In, check the following prerequisites:

* The protected computer must be powered on and able to be connected over the network.

* The required version of Veeam Plug-In must be available on the distribution server.
