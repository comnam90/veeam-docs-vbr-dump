# Backup Proxies

In this article

A backup proxy is an architecture component that sits between the backup server and other components of the backup infrastructure. While the backup server administers tasks, the proxy processes jobs and delivers backup traffic.

You can add the following types of proxies to the backup infrastructure:

* [General-Purpose Backup Proxy](backup_proxy_general.md)
* [VMware Backup Proxy](backup_proxy.md)
* [CDP Proxy](cdp_proxy.md)
* [Off-Host Backup Proxy](offhost_backup_proxy.md)
