# Before You Begin


Before you create a CDP policy, check the following prerequisites:

* Check that all the required components are added to the backup infrastructure. For more information on the required components, see [Backup Infrastructure for Universal CDP](uni_cdp_infrastructure.md).
* Make sure that the workloads you plan to protect were rebooted after the [installation](uni_cdp_service_install.md) of the Veeam CDP Agent Service and Veeam CDP Volume Filter Driver.
* The I/O filter must be installed on each cluster where you plan to replicate data. For more information on how to install the filter, see [Installing I/O Filter](cdp_io_filter_install.md).
