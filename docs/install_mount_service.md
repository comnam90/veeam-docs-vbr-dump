# Configuring Default Mount Server


You can designate any server in your infrastructure that meets the [system requirements](system_requirements.md#mount) as the default Microsoft Windows-based or Linux-based mount server. To assign this role, you must install the Mount Service on the selected server.

To manually specify a new default mount server and install the Mount Service on it, use the Install Mount Service wizard.

1. [Launch the Install Mount Service wizard](install_mount_service_launch.md).
2. [Specify the mount server settings](install_mount_service_mount_server.md).
3. [Apply the mount server settings](install_mount_service_apply.md).
