# Creating Backup Copy Job


To copy backups to a secondary location, you must configure a backup copy job. The backup copy job defines how, where and when to copy backups. One job can be used to process backups of one or more machines.

You can configure a job and start it immediately or save the job to start it later.

Before creating a job, [check prerequisites](backup_copy_prerequisites_mssql.md). Then use the New Backup Copy Job wizard to configure a backup copy job.

1. [Launch Backup Copy Job wizard](backup_copy_launch_mssql.md).
2. [Specify a job name and description](backup_copy_name_mssql.md).
3. [Select backups to process](backup_copy_backups_mssql.md).
4. [Define backup copy target](backup_copy_target_mssql.md).
5. [Specify advanced settings](backup_copy_advanced_mssql.md).
6. [Define backup copy schedule](backup_copy_schedule_mssql.md).
7. [Finish working with the wizard](backup_copy_summary_mssql.md).
