# Restoring Posts

In this article

You can use Veeam Explorer for Microsoft Teams to restore posts of a team channel. When you restore posts, you can choose to restore all posts of a channel or restore posts published within a specified time period.

| Note |
| Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 does not restore posts to their original location in the team channel. Instead, Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 creates a new tab in the original channel and restores posts to this tab. If you want to restore posts to another channel, use the export operation. For more information, see [Data Export](vet_export.md). |

To restore posts, do the following:

1. [Launch the Restore wizard](vet_launch_restore_posts.md).
2. [Select an authentication method](vet_select_auth_restore_posts.md).
3. [Log in to Microsoft 365](vet_login_restore_posts.md).
4. [Specify restore options](vet_restore_options_posts.md).
5. [Review the operation summary](summary26.md).
