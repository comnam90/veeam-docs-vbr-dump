# Deployment


Starting from version 12.2, the Veeam Backup & Replication solution comes with a plug-in that allows you to add Nutanix AHV servers to the backup infrastructure, and to manage data protection and recovery operations for Nutanix AHV workloads from a single console.

To access the plug-in functionality, you can either deploy a new backup server as described in section  [Deployment](deployment.md) or use a backup server that already exists in your backup infrastructure if it meets the [Veeam Plug-in for Nutanix AHV system requirements](ahv_system_requirements.md).
