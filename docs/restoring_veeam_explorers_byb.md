# Before You Begin

In this article

Before you recover application items, consider the following:

* The backup or replica you plan to restore from must be created with application-aware processing enabled. For more information, see the Specify Guest Processing Settings step of the job or policy wizard for the relevant hypervisor, cloud or physical platform. For example, see [Specify Guest Processing Settings](backup_job_vss_vm.md) for VMware vSphere backup jobs started in the Veeam Backup & Replication console.
* For recovery from storage snapshots, check the requirements in [Data Recovery from Storage Snapshots](storage_limitations_general.md#vess).
* For recovery from VeeamZIP backups, check the requirements in [VeeamZIP](veeamzip.md).
* For requirements and limitations during restore see the relevant Explorer sections.
