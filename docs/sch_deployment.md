# Deployment


Starting from version 12.3.2, the Veeam Backup & Replication solution allows you to add Scale Computing HyperCore servers to the backup infrastructure, and to manage data protection and recovery operations for Scale Computing HyperCore workloads from a single console.

To access the Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore functionality, you can either deploy a new backup server as described in the [Deployment](deployment.md) section or use a backup server that already exists in your backup infrastructure if it meets the [Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore system requirements](sch_system_requirements.md).

| Note |
| If you are using a Linux-based backup server and upgrading Veeam Backup & Replication from 13 to 13.0.1, Veeam Plug-in for Scale Computing HyperCore will not be automatically installed. For details on how to install it manually, see section [Installing Updates](update_appliance_install_updates.md). |
