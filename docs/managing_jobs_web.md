# Managing Backup Jobs Using Web UI


To view all jobs configured on the backup server, open the Jobs node in the [management pane](vbr_web_console.md). The list of available jobs is displayed in the working area. You can edit job properties, start and stop jobs, restart failed jobs, clone jobs, view job statistics and delete unnecessary jobs.
