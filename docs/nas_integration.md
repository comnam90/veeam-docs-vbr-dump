# NAS Integration (Storage Systems)


Veeam Backup & Replication allows you to integrate your storage systems with NAS file shares residing on them into your infrastructure. For more information, see the [Adding Enterprise Storage System as NAS Filer](adding_nas_filer.md) section in the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide.

To start working with storage systems, you must properly configure the backup infrastructure. For more information, see [Infrastructure Overview](storage_infrastructure.md). After that, you can use storage snapshots for data protection and disaster recovery operations.

Supported Storage Systems

For the list of storage systems that support NAS integration, see [System Requirements](storage_system_requirements.md#nas).
