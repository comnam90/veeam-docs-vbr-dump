# Installing Veeam Agent


You can install Veeam Agent on a specific protected computer in the inventory. This operation may be required, for example, if you want to test the installation process before allowing Veeam Backup & Replication to deploy Veeam Agent to all computers included in the protection group.

Before you install Veeam Agent, check that the protected computer is powered on and able to be connected over the network.

To install Veeam Agent on a protected computer:

1. Open the Inventory view.
2. In the inventory pane, expand the Physical Infrastructure node and select the necessary protection group.
3. In the working area, select the necessary computer and click Install Agent on the ribbon or right-click the computer and select Agent > Install agent and select the plug-in you want to install.
