# Step 10. Finish Configuration

In this article

At the Summary step of the Initial Configuration wizard, review the system configuration and select Finish. The system will apply the configuration and restart required services.

After you finish the initial configuration, general information about the server will be displayed. You can use it to log in to the Host Management console and continue configuring Veeam Infrastructure Appliance. For more information, see [Configuring Veeam Appliances](hmc.md).

To add the component to your backup infrastructure, the component must be configured in your Veeam Backup & Replication console.
