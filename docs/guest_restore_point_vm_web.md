# Step 2. Select Restore Point

In this article

To select a restore point:

1. Click Select restore point.
2. In the Select Restore Point window, you can select the latest restore point by clicking Select latest restore point. Alternatively, you can select a day when the restore point was created. In the Available restore points list, select the necessary restore point.

You can change the restore point while browsing the guest OS files.
