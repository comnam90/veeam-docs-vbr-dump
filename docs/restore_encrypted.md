# Restoring Data from Encrypted Backups


To restore encrypted data, you need to decrypt them first. For more information, see [Decrypting Backups](decrypt_with_pass.md).

Data restore from the decrypted backup does not differ from that from an unencrypted one. For more information, see [Data Recovery for VMware vSphere](data_recovery.md).
