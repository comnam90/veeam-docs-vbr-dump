# What You Do Next


After the disks are published, go to the following locations on the target server to browse disks content:

* [For Windows servers] Go to C:\VeeamFLR\ folder.

* [For Linux servers] Go to the /tmp/Veeam.Mount.Disks location to browse disks images. Go to the /tmp/Veeam.Mount.FS location to browse disks content.

After you started a disks publishing session, you can view the session statistics or stop the session from the Veeam backup console. To learn more, see [Managing Publishing Disks Session](integration_publish_session.md).
