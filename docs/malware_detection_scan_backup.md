# Scan Backup


Scan Backup allows you to perform the following operations:

* Find the last clean restore point after a recent malware attack.
* Find the last clean restore point if the date of the malware attack is unknown.
* Find some specific information, for example, sensitive data.

To scan restore points, Veeam Backup & Replication uses the following engines:

* Veeam Threat Hunter — a signature-based scan engine. For more information, see [Veeam Threat Hunter for Scan Backup](malware_detection_scan_backup_veeam_threat_hunter.md).
* Third-party antivirus software. For more information, see [Antivirus Scan for Scan Backup](malware_detection_scan_backup_antivirus.md).
* YARA — a rule-based scan engine. For more information, see [YARA Scan for Scan Backup](malware_detection_scan_backup_yara.md).
