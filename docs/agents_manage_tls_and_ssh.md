# Configuring Security Settings


When you configure the Veeam Agent management infrastructure in Veeam Backup & Replication, you can specify what security settings Veeam Backup & Replication will use to establish a secure connection between the backup server and protected computers.

To learn more about how to manage the connection between the backup server and protected computers, see [Backup Server Certificate](backup_server_certificate.md) and [Hosts Authentication](linux_fingerprint_check.md).
