# Object Storage Data Recovery

In this article

You can restore data previously backed up with object storage backup jobs. You can restore the following data:

* Whole buckets or containers of object storage repositories.
* Objects of the certain restore point.
* Multiple objects versions.

Veeam Backup & Replication offers several recovery options for different recovery scenarios:

* [Restore of the entire bucket or container](os_data_recovery_restore_entire_bucket.md) allows you to restore a whole object storage bucket or container to one of the restore points.
* [Rollback to a point in time](os_data_recovery_roll_back_to_point.md) allows you to restore only changed objects to one of the restore points.
* [Restore of individual objects](os_data_recovery_restore_individual_objects.md) allows you to select objects to restore to one of the restore points.
* [Restore of objects from the archive repository](os_data_recovery_restore_files_from_archive.md) allows you to select archived objects to restore to one of the restore points.
