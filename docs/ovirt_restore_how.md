# VM Restore


Veeam Backup & Replication offers the following restore options:

* [Entire VM Restore](ovirt_restore_how_entire.md) — restores an entire VM from a backup. You can restore one or more VMs at a time, to the original location or to a new location.
* [Disk Restore](ovirt_restore_how_disk_restore.md) — restores persistent disks attached to a VM from an image-level backup. You can restore persistent disks to the original location or to a new location.
* [File-level Recovery](ovirt_restore_how_flr.md) — recovers individual VM files and folders from a backup. You can download the necessary files and folders to a local machine, or restore the files and folders of the source VM to the original location.

You can restore VM data to the most recent state or to any available restore point.
