# Item Recovery

In this article

Platform-independent item recovery includes the following methods:

* [Guest OS file restore](guest_file_recovery.md) — to recover individual guest OS files from Windows, Linux, Mac and other guest OS file systems. You can recover files and folders directly from a regular image-level backup, storage snapshot or replica.
* [Application items restore](restore_veeam_explorers.md) — to recover items from different applications such as Microsoft Active Directory, Microsoft SQL Server and so on. Application items are recovered directly from backups and replicas. To recover application items, Veeam Backup & Replication uses the capabilities of Veeam Explorers.

Veeam Backup & Replication also provides platform-specific item recovery methods. For more information, see the Data Recovery section for the necessary platform.
