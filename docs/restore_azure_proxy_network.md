| If you want to restore from backups in an on-premises object storage repository, the selected virtual network must have access to the source object storage repository. To provide access to object storage repositories, you can use VPN or Azure ExpressRoute. For more information, see [this Veeam KB article](https://www.veeam.com/kb4014). |
