# Restore from Tape


You can restore data previously backed up to tape. Veeam Backup & Replication offers several recovery options for different recovery scenarios:

* Restore VMs directly to infrastructure.
* Restore VMs through a staging repository.
* Restore backups from tape to repository.
* Restore tenants' backups from tape.
* Restore files and folders.
* Restore object backup from tape to object storage or repository.
