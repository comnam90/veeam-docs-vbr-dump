2. Open the Advanced tab.

1. If you want to enable extended logging mode to collect logs that contain additional information on specific operations, select the Enable extended logging check box. After enabling extended logging mode, you can go back to the application and perform actions for which you want to collect additional information. Then you can collect logs. For more information on log collection, see [Getting Support](veod_support.md).
