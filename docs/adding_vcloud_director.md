# Adding VMware Cloud Director Servers

In this article

To work with vApps and VMs managed by VMware Cloud Director, you must add VMware Cloud Director to the backup infrastructure.

When you add VMware Cloud Director to the backup infrastructure, the VMware Cloud Director hierarchy is displayed under the Cloud Director view. You can work with VMs managed by VMware Cloud Director directly in the Veeam Backup & Replication console. For more information on how to open the Cloud Director view, see [Viewing VMware Cloud Director VMs](vcloud_viewing_vms.md).

To add the VMware Cloud Director server, use the New VMware Cloud Director wizard.

1. [Launch the New VMware Cloud Director Server wizard](adding_vcloud_director_launch.md).
2. [Specify a server name or address](vcloud_name.md).
3. [Specify VMware Cloud Director credentials](vcloud_credentials.md).
4. [Specify credentials for underlying vCenter Servers](vcloud_vc.md).
5. [Finish working with the wizard](vcloud_finish.md).
