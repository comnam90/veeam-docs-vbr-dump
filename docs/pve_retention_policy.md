# Retention Policies


Image-level backups created by jobs are not kept forever — they are removed according to retention policy settings specified while creating the jobs as described in section [Creating Backup Jobs](pve_backup_job_create.md).

Restore points in the backup chain are stored only for the allowed period of time (in days). If a restore point is older than the specified time limit, Veeam Backup & Replication removes it from the backup chain. To learn how Veeam Backup & Replication applies retention policies to forever forward incremental and forward incremental backup chains, see [Backup Retention](pve_backup_retention.md).
