# Resources


REST API is built around resources. A resource is an object that the client can address and with which it can perform certain actions. Some examples of resources in Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager are backup server, job, restore point and so on.

Resources in Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager REST API are described with:

* [Resource type](resource_types.md) such as backupServer, job and so on
* [URL](resource_urls.md), or resource address, that the client can use to access the resource
* [Relationships to other resources](links.md) in Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager
* [Optional] [Set of operations](http_requests_and_responses.md) that the client can perform with the resource
