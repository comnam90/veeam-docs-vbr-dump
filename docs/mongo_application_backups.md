# Managing Application Backups


You can perform administration tasks with backups created on a Veeam backup repository by application backup policies configured in Veeam Backup & Replication. You can perform the following tasks:

* [Restore a database item from an application backup using Veeam Explorer](mongo_application_backups_restore.md).

* [Delete an application backup from configuration](mongo_application_backups_remove_from_configuration.md).
* [Delete an application backup from disk](mongo_backup_delete.md).
* [Create a backup copy](mongo_backup_copy.md).
