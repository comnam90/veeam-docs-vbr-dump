# Before You Begin


Before you add a worker to the backup infrastructure, consider the following:

* Each worker must be provided with sufficient compute resources to handle backup and restore tasks in parallel. The maximum number of concurrent tasks is configured in worker settings — if this number is exceeded, the worker will not start a new task until one of the current tasks finishes.
* You can change the maximum number of concurrent tasks (the best practice is to allocate 1 vCPU and 1 GB RAM for each additional task) while deploying a new worker or editing settings of an existing one.
