Veeam Backup & Replication with Veeam Kasten Plug-In for Veeam Backup & Replication allows you to add Kasten instances to Veeam Backup & Replication and manage data protection and recovery operations for these instances from a single Veeam Backup & Replication console. You can use Veeam Backup & Replication with the installed plug-in to perform the following operations:

* Add the Kasten instance to the Veeam Backup & Replication infrastructure, manage and remove it.
* Manage Kasten policies from the Veeam Backup & Replication infrastructure.
* View Kasten backups exported by Kasten policies.
* Restore from Kasten backups.
* Restore from Kasten snapshots.
* Monitor session statistics.

If you export Kasten backups to the Veeam backup repository, you can also perform the following operations:

* Remove backups exported by Kasten policies from the Veeam Backup & Replication infrastructure.
* Synthesize an independent full backup file using restore points that are located in your Veeam backup repositories.
* Export disks.
* Perform First Class Disk Recovery.
* Restore guest OS files and folders of backups.
* Export backup files.
