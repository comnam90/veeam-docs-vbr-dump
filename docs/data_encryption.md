# Data Encryption

In this article

Data security is an important part of the backup strategy. You must protect your information from unauthorized access, especially if you back up sensitive VM data to off-site locations or archive it to tape. To keep your data safe, use data encryption.

Data encryption transforms data to an unreadable, scrambled format. If encrypted data is intercepted, it cannot be unlocked and read by the eavesdropper. Only intended recipients who know the secret key can reverse encrypted information to a readable format.

This section contains information about encrypting backup files and data stored in the configuration database. For more information about encrypting communication between backup infrastructure components, see [Communications Encryption](communications_encryption.md).
