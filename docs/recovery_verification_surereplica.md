# SureReplica

In this article

To guarantee recoverability of your data, Veeam Backup & Replication complements the SureBackup recovery verification technology with SureReplica.

SureReplica is in many respects similar to the SureBackup recovery verification. It lets you validate your disaster recovery environment without impacting the production infrastructure. You can automatically verify every created restore point of every VM replica and ensure that they are functioning as expected.

The SureReplica technology is not limited only to VM replica verification. Just like SureBackup, it provides the following capabilities:

* SureReplica: automated VM replicas verification, including storage snapshot replicas.
* On-Demand Sandbox: an isolated environment for testing VM replicas, training and troubleshooting.
* U-AIR: recovery of individual items from applications running on VM replicas.
