| Tip |
| After you specify necessary settings for the file to tape job, you can save them as default settings. To do this, click Save as Default at the bottom left corner of the Advanced Settings window. When you create a new file to tape job, Veeam Backup & Replication will automatically apply default settings to the new job. |
