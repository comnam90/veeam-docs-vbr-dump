# Step 8. Finish Migration


To finish the migration process, do the following:

* If you have replication jobs, map VM replicas manually to each replication job.
* Re-add VM containers to the list of source VMs in the jobs settings. Click Recalculate to make sure that all source objects were found.
* Recreate virtual labs.
* If you use exclusions to remove objects from processing in your jobs, verify and update the exclusion lists for each job.
