# Creating Standard Account Using Web UI


To add a new standard credentials record, do the following in the Veeam Backup & Replication web UI:

1. Click the gear icon in the top bar.
2. Select Credentials & Passwords in the management pane.
3. In the Datacenter Credentials tab, click Add Credentials > Standard account.
4. In the Username field, enter a user name for the account that you want to add.
5. In the Password field, enter a password for the account that you want to add. To view the entered password, click and hold the eye icon on the right of the field.
6. In the Description field, enter a description for the created credentials record. As there can be a number of similar account names, for example, Administrator, it is recommended that you provide a meaningful unique description for the credentials record so that you can distinguish it in the list. The description is shown in brackets, following the user name.
7. Click OK.
