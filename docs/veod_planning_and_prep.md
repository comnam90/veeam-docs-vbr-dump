# Planning and Preparation


Veeam Explorer for Microsoft OneDrive for Business comes as part of the Veeam Explorer for Microsoft SharePoint installation package and has the same [system requirements](vesp_systemreqs.md).

Consider that when Veeam Explorer for Microsoft SharePoint is installed on a server on which both Veeam Backup & Replication and Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 are installed, the notification settings will be inherited from the Veeam Backup & Replication Global Notification settings.
