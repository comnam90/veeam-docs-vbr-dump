# Data Restore

In this article

With Veeam Backup & Replication, you can restore MongoDB instances or collections from backups that reside on Veeam backup repositories. You can restore to the original location or another server. You can also restore from a backup copy based on MongoDB backups.

If you have backed up database logs, you can perform point-in-time recovery. For details on the log backup, see [Oplog Backup](mongo_oplog_backup.md).

Restore operations are performed on the Veeam Backup & Replication side. For restore, Veeam Backup & Replication uses the functionality of Veeam Explorer for MongoDB. For details, see [Restoring with Veeam Explorer for MongoDB](mongo_restore.md).
