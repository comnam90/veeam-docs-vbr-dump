# Before You Begin


Before you create a CDP policy, check the following prerequisites:

* Check that all the required components are added to the backup infrastructure. For more information on the required components, see [Backup Infrastructure for Cloud Director CDP](vcloud_director_cdp_infrastructure.md).
* The I/O filter must be installed on each VDC where VMs that you plan to protect reside. For more information on how to install the filter, see [Installing I/O Filter on VDCs](vcloud_director_cdp_io_filter_install.md).
* If you plan to use [replica seeding](cdp_seeding.md), you must create a seed as described in section [Creating vApp Replica Seeds](vcd_replica_create_seed.md).
