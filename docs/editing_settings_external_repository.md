| Veeam Backup & Replication automatically determines and sets locations for external repositories based on the datacenter region. You can check the datacenter region for each external repository at the [Bucket](external_repository_details.md) step of the Edit External Repository wizard. For more information on locations, see [Managing Locations](locations.md). |
