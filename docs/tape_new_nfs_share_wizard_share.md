# Step 2. Specify Path to NFS File Share

In this article

At the NFS File Share step of the wizard, specify the path to an NFS file share in the server:/folder format.

You can add the root server folder in the server:/ format to protect all NFS file shares residing on this server. You can specify the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the server. Note that you can use IPv6 addresses only if IPv6 communication is enabled as described in the [IPv6 Support](ipv6.md) section.
