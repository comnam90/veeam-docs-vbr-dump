# Working with Application Policies


Veeam Backup & Replication allows you to create application backup policies and jobs for the following Veeam Plug-Ins:

* [Creating Oracle RMAN Backup Policy](create_policy_create_oracle_rman.md)
* [Creating SAP HANA Backup Policy](create_policy_create_sap_hana.md)
* [Creating SAP on Oracle Backup Policy](create_policy_create_sap_oracle.md)
* [Creating Microsoft SQL Server Backup Policy](create_policy_create_microsoft_sql_server.md)

After you configured an application backup policy in Veeam Backup & Replication, you can manage it in Veeam Backup & Replication as well. To learn more, see [Managing Application Backup Policies](manage_policy.md).
