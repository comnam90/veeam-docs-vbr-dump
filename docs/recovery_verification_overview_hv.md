| The recovery verification functionality is included in the Veeam Universal License.  When using a legacy socket-based license, Enterprise or higher edition is required. If you use the Standard edition, you can manually verify VM backups with Instant Recovery. For more information, see [Manual Recovery Verification](surebackup_manual.md). |
