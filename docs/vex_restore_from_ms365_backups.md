# Restore from Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 Backups


Veeam Explorer for Microsoft Exchange allows you to perform granular restore of Microsoft Exchange data. You can restore data of mailboxes and mailbox folders as well as specific emails, calendar items, contacts, tasks, notes, journal items, and so on.

You can restore Microsoft Exchange data from backups created by Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 to the original location or other [Microsoft 365 organizations](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbo365/guide/vbo_add_office365_org.html?ver=80) and [on-premises Microsoft organizations](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbo365/guide/vbo_add_onpremises_org.html?ver=80).

Consider the following:

* If your Veeam Explorer for Microsoft Exchange comes as part of Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365, the backup content is loaded automatically when you open Veeam Explorer for Microsoft Exchange.
* If your Veeam Explorer for Microsoft Exchange comes as part of Veeam Backup & Replication, add a Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 server. For more information, see [Adding Veeam Backup for Microsoft 365 Server](vex_adding_adb.md).

Before restoring data, read the [Considerations and Limitations](vex_considerations.md) section.
