# Installing Veeam Plug-In for Microsoft SQL Server


You can install Veeam Plug-In for Microsoft SQL Server using the installation wizard or in an unattended mode using the command-line interface.

|  |
| --- |
| Note |
| When you launch Veeam Plug-In installation, the installation wizard also installs Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2 if it does not detect this component on the machine. In some cases, installation of .NET Framework requires a reboot of the machine. This can happen, for example, if you have an earlier version of .NET Framework installed on the machine, and during the installation process it is used by third-party software. |
