# Step 2. Specify Policy Name

In this article

At the Name step of the wizard, specify a name and description for the application backup policy.

1. In the Name field, enter a name for the application backup policy.
2. In the Description field, provide a description for future reference. The default description contains information about the user who created the policy, date and time when the policy was created.
3. Select the High priority check box if you want the resource scheduler of Veeam Backup & Replication to prioritize this job higher than other similar jobs and to allocate resources to it in the first place. For details, see [Job Priorities](job_priorities.md).
