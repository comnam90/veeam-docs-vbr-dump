# Veeam Backup & Replication Installation on Microsoft Windows


To start working with Veeam Backup & Replication, you must configure a backup server — install Veeam Backup & Replication on a machine that meets the system requirements. To do this, you can use the setup wizard or install the product in the unattended mode.

When you install Veeam Backup & Replication, the Veeam Backup & Replication console is automatically installed on the backup server. If you want to access Veeam Backup & Replication remotely, you can install the Veeam Backup & Replication console on a dedicated machine or use the [web UI](vbr_web_console.md).
