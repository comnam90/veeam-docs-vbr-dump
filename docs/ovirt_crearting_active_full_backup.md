# Creating Active Full Backups


You can manually create an [active full backup](ovirt_active_full_backup.md) for all VMs added to a backup job:

1. Open the Home view.
2. In the inventory pane, select Jobs.
3. In the working area, right-click the necessary job and select Active full.

Alternatively, select the job and click Active Full on the ribbon.
