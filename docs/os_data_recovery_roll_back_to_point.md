# Rolling Back to a Point in Time

In this article

You can roll back changes made to data in object storage buckets or containers to a specific restore point that is older than the current buckets or container state. This option can be useful, for example, when the original bucket or container was attacked by ransomware. In this case you can roll back all the data that was changed by the ransomware to the state before the attack.

Before you roll back the buckets or containers to a point in time, [check prerequisites](roll_back_bucket_to_point.md). Then use the Bucket rollback to a point in time wizard to restore buckets or containers.

1. [Launch the Bucket Rollback to a Point in Time wizard](roll_back_bucket_to_point_launch.md).
2. [Select buckets or containers to restore](roll_back_bucket_to_point_buckets.md).
3. [Finish working with the wizard](roll_back_bucket_to_point_summary.md).
