# Restore to Microsoft 365 Organizations

In this article

You can restore data to Microsoft 365 organizations with enabled [multi-factor authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide) (MFA).

When you restore your data with this option, you can specify a target mailbox, select an authentication method that you want to use, specify a target folder to which you want to restore data and configure restore options.

You can also use [1-Click Restore](vex_one_click_restore.md) if you do not want to configure a restore session and prefer to restore your data using the default settings.
