# Deployment


Starting from version 12.2, the Veeam Backup & Replication solution allows you to add oVirt KVM Managers to the backup infrastructure, and to manage data protection and recovery operations for oVirt KVM workloads from a single console.

To access the Veeam Plug-in for oVirt KVM functionality, you can either [deploy a new backup server](install_console.md) or use a backup server that already exists in your backup infrastructure if it meets the [Veeam Plug-in for oVirt KVM system requirements](ovirt_system_requirements.md).
