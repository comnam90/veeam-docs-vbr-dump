# Step 4. Finish Working with Wizard


At the Summary step of the wizard, review details of the failover task and click Finish to exit the wizard.

During the failover process, Veeam Backup & Replication will request the target host to power on the replicas.

What You Do Next

Failover is an intermediate step that needs to be finalized. You can finalize failover in the following ways:

* [Perform permanent failover](cdp_performing_perm_failover.md).
* [Undo failover](cdp_undoing_failover.md).
* [Perform failback](cdp_performing_failback.md).
