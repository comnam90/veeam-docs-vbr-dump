# Veeam Agent Backup

In this article

Veeam Backup & Replication allows you to protect computers running the following operating systems:

* Microsoft Windows
* Linux
* IBM AIX
* Oracle Solaris
* Mac

Veeam Backup & Replication uses backup agents installed on each computer. You can perform the whole set of deployment, administration, data protection and disaster recovery tasks on Veeam Agent computers remotely from the Veeam Backup & Replication console.

You can perform the following data protection and recovery operations with physical machines:

* Create crash-consistent and [application-consistent](platform_support.md#guest) backups. Save them in different repositories: direct attached storage, network attached storage, deduplicating storage appliances, object storage, cloud connect repository and so on.

* Copy backups to 3rd party locations.

* Recover computers as VMs of different platforms (VMware vSphere, Hyper-V, Nutanix, MS Azure, Amazon EC2 and so on), recover volumes, files, application items and so on.
* Perform recovery verification.
* Archive data to tapes.

For all data protection and recovery operations, you can see real-time statistics and get reports by email.
