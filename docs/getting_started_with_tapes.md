# Getting Started with Tapes

In this article

After you have connected tape devices, you need to complete the following steps:

1. [Add a tape server](adding_tape_server.md) to the Veeam backup server.
2. Load tapes to the tape device (if not yet loaded) and run the [importing procedure](import_tapes.md) for them.
3. Create one or more [media pool](creating_custom_media_pools.md) or [GFS media pool](creating_gfs_media_pools.md) that will be used as targets for tape jobs.
4. Configure one or more [media vaults](creating_media_vaults.md) to conveniently organize offline tapes.
5. Configure and run [backup to tape](creating_backup_to_tape_jobs.md), [file to tape](file_to_tape_jobs.md) or [object storage to tape](object_to_tape_jobs.md) jobs.
6. Restore [virtual machines to infrastructure](vm_restore_from_tape.md) or [both virtual and physical machines to repository](vm_restore_from_tape_to_repository.md), or [restore files](file_restore_from_tape.md) and [objects from tape](object_restore_from_tape.md).
