# Direct Storage Access


In the Direct storage access mode, Veeam Backup & Replication reads/writes data directly from/to the storage system where VM data or backups are located. This mode comprises two transport modes:

* [Direct SAN access](direct_san_access.md)
* [Direct NFS access](direct_nfs_access.md)
