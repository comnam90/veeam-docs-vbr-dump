# Managing Application Backups


You can perform administration tasks with backups created on a Veeam backup repository by application backup policies configured in Veeam Backup & Replication. For such backups, Veeam Backup & Replication allows you to perform the same set of operations as for backups created with application policies configured directly on a protected computer. You can perform the following tasks:

* [Restore a database item from an application backup using Veeam Explorer](application_backups_restore_with_explorer.md).

* [Create a recovery token for a computer](application_backups_recovery_token.md).
* [Delete an application backup from configuration](application_backups_remove_from_configuration.md).
* [Delete an application backup from disk](application_backups_delete.md).
* [Create a backup copy](application_backups_copy.md).
