# Restoring VM from Tape to Infrastructure


To restore VMs from tape to virtual infrastructure, use the Entire VM Restore wizard. This section will guide you through all steps of the wizard and provide explanation on available options.

If the tapes are online in your tape device, Veeam Backup & Replication will get the needed data automatically. If the tapes are offline, Veeam Backup & Replication will list the names of the required tapes.

To restore VMs from tape, follow the next steps:

1. [Launch the Entire VM Restore wizard](restore_vms_from_tape_launch.md).
2. [Choose virtual machines to restore](restore_vms_from_tape_vms.md).
3. [Select a restore point](restore_vms_from_tape_point.md).
4. [Choose backup repository](restore_vms_from_tape_staging.md).
5. [Specify restore mode and other recovery options](restore_vms_from_tape_options.md).
