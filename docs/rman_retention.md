# Retention of RMAN Backups and Archived Logs

In this article

In the main scenario, when using Veeam Plug-In for Oracle RMAN, you must configure retention policies for RMAN backups and archived redo logs using native Oracle RMAN functionality:

* [Configuring Retention Policy](retention_rman_config.md)
* [Configuring Archived Redo Log Retention](archived_redo_retention.md)

Also, you can manually delete backups from a backup repository using the Veeam Backup & Replication console and enable the force deletion functionality of Veeam Plug-In for Oracle RMAN. For details, see the following sections:

* [Configuring Force Deletion of Backups](force_delete_rman.md)
* [Deleting Backups Manually](delete_backups_rman.md)
* [Removing Backups from Configuration](delete_manual_rman.md)
