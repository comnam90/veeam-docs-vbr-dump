# Microsoft Azure Data Lake

In this article

Before you add a Microsoft Data Lake storage to the inventory of the virtual infrastructure, consider the following:

* The object storage meets requirements and limitations listed in the [Platform Support](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/platform_support.html?ver=120#nas-backup-support) section.

* If you plan to use dedicated proxy servers, make sure these components are added in the [Backup Infrastructure](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/unstructured_data_backup_infrastructure.html?ver=120).

To add a Microsoft Azure Data Lake storage as a source of unstructured data, do the following:

1. [Launch the New Object Storage wizard.](os_data_lake_launch.md)
2. [Specify account settings.](os_data_lake_account.md)
3. [Specify object storage processing settings.](os_data_lake_processing.md)
4. [Apply object storage settings.](os_data_lake_settings.md)
5. [Finish working with the wizard.](os_data_lake_finish.md)
