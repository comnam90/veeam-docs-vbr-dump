# Using Backup Server as Hardened Repository

In this article

You can use your Veeam Backup & Replication backup server as a hardened repository without additional preparation. This provides the same functionality as a hardened repository on a dedicated server.

Due to the presence of additional services and fewer restrictions, using a backup server as a hardened repository increases the attack surface of your backup infrastructure. For medium-sized and large-scale environments, it is recommended to deploy a hardened repository on a dedicated server.
