# Veeam Incident API


You can run a quick backup session when Veeam Backup & Replication gets a Veeam Incident API response that triggers a malware detection event. To do this, perform the following steps:

1. From the main menu, select Malware Detection > Incident API.
2. Select the Perform a Quick Backup upon receiving an external event check box.

| Note |
| If there are several machines with malware detection events triggered by the Veeam Incident API, quick backup will process these machines one by one. |
