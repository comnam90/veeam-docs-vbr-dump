# Backup Server Certificate


When you configure the Veeam Backup & Replication infrastructure, you can specify what TLS certificate must be used to establish a secure connection from backup infrastructure components to the backup server. Veeam Backup & Replication offers the following options for TLS certificates:

* Keep the default self-signed TLS certificate generated by Veeam Backup & Replication at the process of upgrading to a new version of Veeam Backup & Replication.
* Use Veeam Backup & Replication to generate a new self-signed TLS certificate. To learn more, see [Generating Self-Signed Certificate](self_signed_tls.md).
* Select an existing TLS certificate from the certificate store. To learn more, see [Importing Certificate from Certificate Store](import_tls.md).
* Import a TLS certificate from a file in the PFX format. To learn more, see [Importing Certificate from PFX Files](import_tls_pfx.md).

If you plan to use a certificate issued by your own Certificate Authority (CA), make sure that the certificate meets the requirements. For more information, see [Using Certificate Signed by Internal CA](tls_internal_ca.md).

| Important |
| If you update the TLS certificate used on the backup server, you must also do the following:   * If multi-factor authentication is enabled, any Veeam Backup & Replication consoles connected to the backup server must be restarted to avoid connection issues. * If you use Veeam Plug-In for Nutanix AHV, restart the Veeam AHV Service. For more information on restarting services, see [Performing Maintenance Tasks](hmc_perform_maintenance_tasks.md). * For RHV Backup proxies, pass through the Edit Red Hat Virtualization Proxy wizard. To do this, in the Backup Infrastructure view, right-click a proxy and select Properties. In the wizard, click Finish. * For VMware clusters, pass through the I/O filter Management wizard as described in section [Installing I/O Filter](cdp_io_filter_install.md). * For CDP proxies, pass through the Edit CDP Proxy wizard. To do this, in the Backup Infrastructure view, right-click a proxy and select Properties. In the wizard, click Finish.  * To avoid potential synchronization issues, make sure that Veeam Agents are synchronized with Veeam Backup & Replication before you change the existing certificate. To learn more, see [Rescan Job](agents_discovery_job.md). * [For protection groups for pre-installed Veeam Agents] If you change the existing certificate, you must export a new package with setup files to deploy Veeam Agents on new computers that you want to add to the protection group.To learn more, see [Specifying Packages](protection_group_packages.md). |
