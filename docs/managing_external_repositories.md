# Managing External Repositories


You can manage your external repositories in various ways: rescan external repositories to synchronize their state with the state of an object storage, upgrade external repositories by uploading a new version of [Veeam Data Mover](veeam_transport_service.md) to the gateway server, edit settings of the external repositories, or remove the external repositories. For more information about these options, see the following sections.
