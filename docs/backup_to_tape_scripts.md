# Advanced Settings


At the Advanced tab, you can select what backups from the backup chain to copy, enable hardware compression or specify custom scripts that you want to run before and after the backup to tape job.

The advanced options are different for regular backup to tape jobs and GFS tape jobs:

* [Advanced Settings for Tape Job](advanced_advanced.md)
* [Advanced Settings for GFS Tape Job](advanced_advanced_gfs.md)
