# Step 4. Select Mount Mode

In this article

At the Mount Mode step of the wizard, select the First class disk (FCD) option to register virtual disks on a cluster as FCDs.

If you want to register virtual disks on a VM added to an ESXi host, select the VM disk option. In this case, steps of the wizard differ and Veeam Backup & Replication performs the instant disks recovery as described in section [Performing Instant Disk Recovery](performing_instant_disk_recovery.md).
