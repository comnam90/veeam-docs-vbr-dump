# Creating SureBackup Session Reports

In this article

You can generate HTML reports with statistics on the SureBackup job. A report contains detailed data on job sessions: job status, start and end time, details of the session performance, status of verified VMs and test results. You can generate a report for the whole SureBackup job or a specific job session/sessions.

The SureBackup job report contains data on all sessions initiated for a specific job. To generate a SureBackup job report:

1. Open the Home view.
2. In the inventory pane, select Jobs.
3. In the working area, select the SureBackup job and click Report on the ribbon. You can also right-click the SureBackup job and select Report.

The session report contains data on a single job session. To generate a session report:

1. Open the History view.
2. In the inventory pane, select Jobs.
3. In the working area, select the session and click Report on the ribbon. You can also right-click the session and select Report.
