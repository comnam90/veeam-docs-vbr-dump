# Creating Backup Jobs Using Console

In this article

To back up VMs, you must configure a backup job. The backup job defines how, where and when to back up VM data. You can use one job to process one or more VMs. Jobs can be started manually or scheduled to run automatically at a specific time.

Before you create a backup job, [check the prerequisites](backup_job_limitations.md). Then, use the New Backup Job wizard to configure the backup job.

1. [Launch the New Backup Job wizard](backup_job_launch_vm.md).
2. [Specify a job name and description](backup_job_name_vm.md).
3. [Select VMs to back up](backup_job_vms_vm.md).
4. [Exclude objects from the backup job](backup_job_excludes_vm.md).
5. [Define VM backup order](backup_job_order_vm.md).
6. [Specify backup storage settings](backup_job_storage_vm.md).
7. [Configure long-term retention](backup_job_gfs_vm.md).
8. [Specify advanced backup settings](backup_job_advanced_vm.md).
9. [Specify a secondary target](vmware_backup_secondary_target.md).
10. [Specify guest processing settings](backup_job_vss_vm.md).
11. [Define a job schedule](backup_job_schedule_vm.md).
12. [Finish working with the wizard](backup_job_review_vm.md).
