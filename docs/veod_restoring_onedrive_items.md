| By default, Veeam Explorer for Microsoft OneDrive for Business restores only the latest version of OneDrive items to their original location. If you want to restore all versions of OneDrive items and specify another location, you can copy your OneDrive data. For more information, see [Data Copy](veod_copying_onedrive_items.md). |
