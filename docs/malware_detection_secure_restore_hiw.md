# How Secure Restore Works

In this article

For secure restore, malware detection works in the following way:

1. On the mount server, Veeam Backup & Replication runs the Veeam Mount Service to perform the following steps:

1. Mount machine disks from backups to the mount server under the C:\VeeamFLR\<machinename> folder (for Veeam Backup & Replication on Microsoft Windows) or the /tmp/Veeam.Mount.FS/<UUID> directory (for Veeam Backup & Replication on Linux).
2. Initiate a new scan session.

1. If malware activity is not detected, Veeam Backup & Replication will restore the machine or its disks to the target location. The malware detection event will not be created.
2. If malware activity is detected, Veeam Backup & Replication will perform the following steps:

1. Abort the restore process or restore the machine or its disks with restrictions depending on secure restore settings.
2. Create the malware detection event and mark objects as Infected.

By default, the mount server role is assigned to the backup server or a backup repository. However, you can assign the mount server role to any 64-bit Microsoft Windows or Linux machine in your backup infrastructure. For example, you may want to run the malware detection scan on a different server for security reasons. For more information about mount server deployment and requirements, see [Mount Servers](mount_server.md).

| You can also scan machines for malware regularly within a SureBackup job. For information on how to enable the malware scan for a SureBackup job, see the following sections related to specific platforms:   * VMware vSphere — [Specify Additional Job Settings](surebackup_job_settings_vm.md). * Microsoft Hyper-V — [Specify Additional Job Settings](surebackup_job_settings_hv.md) |
