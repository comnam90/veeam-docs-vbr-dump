# Restoring Objects from Tape


To restore the content of an object storage backup from tape, use the Restore from Tape wizard.

If the tapes are online in your tape device, Veeam Backup & Replication gets the needed data automatically. If the tapes are offline, Veeam Backup & Replication lists the names of the required tapes.

To restore objects from tape, follow the next steps:

1. [Launch the Restore from Tape wizard](restore_objects_from_tape_launch.md).
2. [Choose files to restore](restore_objects_from_tape_objects.md).
3. [Specify restore destination](restore_objects_from_tape_destination.md).
4. [Specify restore options](restore_objects_from_tape_options.md).
5. [Finish working with the wizard](restore_objects_from_tape_summary.md).
