| Tip |
| Periodical change of passwords is a security best practice. You can create new passwords as often as you need based on your company security needs and regulatory requirements. |

Credentials stored in the configuration database are encrypted with specific data protection mechanisms. For more information, see [How Database Data Encryption Works](encryption_database_hiw.md).
