# Performing Backup

In this article

After you configured the environment required for Veeam Plug-In for SAP MaxDB, you can back up databases using Database Manager CLI provided by SAP. Veeam Plug-In will automatically transfer backup files to a backup repository and store them in the Veeam proprietary format.

For details about SAP MaxDB database backup, see [SAP MaxDB documentation](https://maxdb.sap.com/doc/7_7/ea/1a116bb3c6428ebbcaff211686be7a/frameset.htm).
