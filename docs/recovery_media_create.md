# Creating Veeam Recovery Media


You can use the backup console to create a Veeam Recovery Media for a Veeam Agent computer that you manage in Veeam Backup & Replication. The process of creating a Veeam Recovery Media in Veeam Backup & Replication practically does not differ from the same procedure performed on a Veeam Agent computer. To learn more about the Veeam Recovery Media, see the [Veeam Recovery Media](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/agentforwindows/userguide/recovery_media.html?ver=13) section in the Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows User Guide.

Keep in mind that you can create Veeam Recovery Media in Veeam Backup & Replication only for computers that are protected with Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows.
