# Adding File Server

In this article

Before you add a Windows- or Linux-managed server as a file server to the inventory of the virtual infrastructure, consider the following:

* This server must meet requirements listed in the [Platform Support](platform_support.md#NAS) section.
* You must have this server added in Backup Infrastructure as a managed server.

For more information on how to add servers, see the [Adding Microsoft Windows Servers](add_windows_server.md) and [Adding Linux Servers](add_linux_server.md) sections.

* If you plan to use a devoted [cache repository](unstructured_data_backup_infrastructure.md#cache_repository), make sure it is added in Backup Infrastructure.

To add a managed Windows or Linux server:

1. [Launch the New File Server wizard](tape_new_file_server_wizard_launch.md).
2. [Add the managed server as a file server](tape_new_file_server_wizard_server.md).
3. [Specify file server processing settings](tape_new_file_server_wizard_processing.md).
4. [Review the components to be installed](tape_new_file_server_wizard_review.md).
5. [Apply file server settings](tape_new_file_server_wizard_apply.md).
6. [Finish working with the wizard](tape_new_file_server_wizard_summary.md).
