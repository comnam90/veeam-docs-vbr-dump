# Step 1. Launch Object Restore Wizard

In this article

To launch the Objects or Versions Restore wizard, do one of the following:

* In the Home tab on the ribbon, click Restore > Object Storage. In the Restore from Object Storage Backup window, click Restore individual objects or their specific versions.
* Open the Home view. In the inventory pane, select Backups. In the working area, expand the necessary backup and do one of the following:

* Click the bucket or container that you want to restore. In the Backup tab on the ribbon, click Objects or Versions.
* Right-click the object storage that you want to restore and select Restore individual objects or versions.

You can restore objects from a backup copy. Backup copies created in the secondary repositories are represented in the Backups > Disk (Copy) node in the inventory pane. If the secondary repository is an object storage repository, backup copies created in it are represented in the Backups > Object Storage (Copy) node in the inventory pane.
