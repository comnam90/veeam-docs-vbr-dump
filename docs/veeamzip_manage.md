# Managing and Restoring VeeamZIP Backups

In this article

Managing for VeeamZIP backups is practically the same as for regular backups. You can view backup properties, copy, move or delete backups from disk. For more information, see the list. Note that links are given for the VMware vSphere platform.

* [Viewing Backup Properties](view_backup_properties.md)
* [Moving Backups](backup_moving.md)
* [Copying Backups](copy_backup.md)
* [Deleting Backups from Disk](delete_backup_from_disk.md)

You can restore your data directly from the VeeamZIP backups back to production servers. VeeamZIP data recovery does not differ from that of a standard backup data recovery and can be performed by using any of the methods from the list. Note that links are given for the VMware vSphere platform.
