# Backup Chain


Backup chain is a sequence of backup files created by Veeam Agent backup jobs. The backup chain provides the ability to recover data.

The backup chain consists of the first full backup file, incremental backup files, metadata files and some additional files. Full and incremental backup files correspond to restore points of the backed-up Veeam Agent computers. Restore points let you roll back Veeam Agent computers to the necessary state.

To learn about types of backup files, see [Backup Files](backup_files.md).
