# Getting Support


If you have any questions or issues with Veeam Explorer for Oracle, you can visit [Veeam R&D Forums](https://forums.veeam.com) or submit a support case on the [Veeam Customer Support Portal](https://www.veeam.com/support.html).

Before you submit a support ticket, make sure that comprehensive information is provided to the Veeam Support Team. To do this, take the following steps:

1. Perform the problematic operation with the extended logging mode enabled. For more information, see [Enabling Extended Logging](veor_extended.md).
2. Use the Export Logs wizard as described in [Exporting Logs](exporting_logs.md). Make sure to export all logs for the relevant backup infrastructure components.
3. If the problematic operation involved restoring data from a backup created with Veeam Plug-In for Oracle RMAN, collect additional logs as described in [this Veeam KB article](https://www.veeam.com/kb2871).
