# Tenant Backup to Tape

In this article

This option is available for Veeam Cloud Connect service providers.

Service providers can back up their tenants' backups from cloud repositories. This allows for better protection of the tenants or for regulations compatibility. For more information, see the [Veeam Cloud Connect](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/cloud/cloud_overview.html) guide.

To back up a tenant to tape, run a backup to tape job. For more information, see the [Backup to Tape](backup_to_tape_jobs.md) section.
