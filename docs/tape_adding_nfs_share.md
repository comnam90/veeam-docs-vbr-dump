# Adding NFS File Share

In this article

Before you add an NFS file share to the inventory of the virtual infrastructure, consider the following:

* The file share meets requirements listed in [Platform Support](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/platform_support.html?ver=120#nas-backup-support).
* If you plan to use a dedicated backup proxy server or cache repository, make sure these components are added in Backup Infrastructure.

To add an NFS file share:

1. [Launch the New File Share wizard](tape_new_nfs_share_wizard_launch.md).
2. [Specify the path to the NFS file share and access credentials](tape_new_nfs_share_wizard_share.md).
3. [Specify advanced NFS file share settings](tape_new_nfs_share_wizard_advanced.md).
4. [Specify file share processing settings](tape_new_nfs_share_wizard_processing.md).
5. [Apply file share settings](tape_new_nfs_share_wizard_apply.md).
6. [Finish working with the wizard](tape_new_nfs_share_wizard_summary.md).
