# Rolling Back to a Point in Time

In this article

You can roll back changes made to files and folders on the file share to a specific restore point that is older than the current file share state. This option can be useful, for example, when the original file share was attacked by ransomware. In this case you can roll back all the files that were changed by the ransomware to the state before the attack.

Before you roll back the file share to a point in time, [check prerequisites](roll_back_to_point_in_time_before_you_begin.md). Then use the File Restore wizard to restore files and folders of the file share.

1. [Launch the File Restore wizard](roll_back_to_point_in_time_launch_wizard.md).
2. [Select an object to restore](roll_back_to_point_in_time_backup.md).
3. [Finish working with the wizard](roll_back_to_point_in_time_summary.md).
