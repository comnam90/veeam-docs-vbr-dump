# Adding Unstructured Data Source


You must add sources of unstructured data, which you plan to protect with the unstructured data backup, to the inventory of the virtual infrastructure.

You can add the following types to the inventory of your virtual infrastructure:

* [Windows-managed or Linux-managed file server](adding_managed_server_file_share.md)
* [File shares](adding_file_share.md)

* [SMB file share](file_share_backup_add_smb_file_share.md)
* [NFS file share](file_share_backup_add_nfs_file_share.md)

* [Enterprise NAS system as a NAS filer](adding_nas_filer.md)
* [Object storage](adding_object_storage.md)
