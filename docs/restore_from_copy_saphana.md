# Restore from Backup Copy


You can restore SAP HANA databases from backup copies created for Veeam Plug-In for SAP HANA backups. The procedure of database restore from a backup copy is the same as database restore to another server. For more information, see [Restore to Another Server (System Copy)](restore_saphana_other_server.md).
