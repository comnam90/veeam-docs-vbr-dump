| TIP |
| You can also find detailed instructions on the Veeam Agent deployment in the readme.txt file that is available among the setup files generated by Veeam Backup & Replication. |

Installation

To install Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows and all the required components, do the following:

1. Upload Veeam Agent setup files on the computer you want to protect. Then navigate to the folder where you have saved setup files.

Keep in mind that you must use Veeam Agent setup files that are generated by Veeam Backup & Replication after the protection group for pre-installed Veeam Agents is created. To learn more, see [Specifying Packages](protection_group_packages.md).

1. To install the Veeam OpenSSL3 FIPS Provider, double-click the VeeamOpenSslFips.v3.0.0.msi file located in the <path\_to\_setup\_files>/Windows/13.0.1.1009 folder.
2. To install .NET Desktop Runtime, double-click the windowsdesktop-runtime-8.0.21-win-x64.exe file located in the <path\_to\_setup\_files>/Windows/13.0.1.1009 folder.
3. To install ASP.NET Core Runtime, double-click the aspnetcore-runtime-8.0.21-win-x64.exe file located in the <path\_to\_setup\_files>/Windows/13.0.1.1009 folder.
4. To install Windows Universal C Runtime (CRT) on Windows Server 2012 R2, find and double-click the following file: <path\_to\_setup\_files>/Windows/13.0.1.1009/VAW/x64/CRT/Windows8.1-KB2999226-x64.msu.

If the computer runs a later version of Microsoft Windows, skip this step.

1. To install Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows, double-click the Veeam\_B&R\_Endpoint\_x64.msi file located in the <path\_to\_setup\_files>/Windows/13.0.1.1009/VAW folder.

Configuration

To configure Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows, you must apply connection settings from the configuration file. You obtained this file together with other setup files when the protection group for pre-installed Veeam Agents was created. To do configure Veeam Agent, execute the following command from the folder where Veeam Agent setup files are located:

|  |
| --- |
| "C:\Program Files\Veeam\Endpoint Backup\Veeam.Agent.Configurator.exe" -setVBRsettings /p:"<protection\_group\_name>.xml" |

where <protection\_group\_name> is a name of the protection group for pre-installed Veeam Agents. Alternatively, you can specify the full path to the configuration file passed with the /p option.

Consider that the connection between Veeam Backup & Replication and Veeam Agent is not persistent. Veeam Agent synchronizes with Veeam Backup & Replication every 6 hours. After you apply new backup policy settings in the Veeam Backup & Replication console, Veeam Agent will get these settings during the next synchronization.

To synchronize Veeam Agent immediately, run the following command on the Veeam Agent computer:

|  |
| --- |
| "C:\Program Files\Veeam\Endpoint Backup\Veeam.Agent.Configurator.exe" -syncnow |
