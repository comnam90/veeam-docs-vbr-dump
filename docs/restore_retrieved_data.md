# Restoring Retrieved Data

In this article

You can restore your data directly from the archive tier back to production servers or to Microsoft Azure, Amazon EC2 or Google Compute Engine platforms. The retrieved data recovery does not differ from standard backup data recovery and can be performed by using any of the methods documented in the [Data Recovery](data_recovery.md) section.
