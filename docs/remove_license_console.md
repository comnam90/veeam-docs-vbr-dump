# Removing License Using Console


You can remove the installed license using the Veeam Backup & Replication console. When you remove a license, Veeam Backup & Replication will switch to the Veeam Backup & Replication Community Edition. For more information, see [Veeam Backup & Replication Community Edition](https://www.veeam.com/virtual-machine-backup-solution-free.html).

You can also remove a part of merged license. If you do so, Veeam Backup & Replication will operate under the other part of the merged license. For more information, see [Merging Licenses](license_merge.md).

To remove a Promo license, remove the license on top of which it was installed.

To remove a license, do the following:

1. From the main menu, select License.
