* TLS certificates to establish a trusted management connection between components. For more information, see [Backup Server Certificate](backup_server_certificate.md).
* TLS encrypted traffic to transfer backup data between components. For more information, see [Enabling Traffic Encryption](enable_network_encryption.md).
