# Replica Recovery Verification Tests


To verify a VM replica, Veeam Backup & Replication performs the same tests as for VM backup verification, except backup validation test. You can run predefined tests or perform your own tests against VMs. The predefined tests include the following ones:

* Heartbeat test
* Ping test
* Application test

For more information, see [Backup Recovery Verification Tests](surebackup_tests.md).
