# Updating License


To be able to use all data protection and disaster recovery features, you must update your license upon expiry. There are two methods to update the license in Veeam Backup & Replication:

* [Update the license manually](license_update_manual.md).
* [Update the license automatically](license_autoupdate.md).

| Note |
| When updating the license, Veeam Backup & Replication requires internet access to connect to the Veeam License Update Server. If your network is not connected to the internet, instead of update you can download a new license file from [my.veeam.com](https://my.veeam.com/) and then install it. For more information on license installation, see [Installing License](install_license.md). |
