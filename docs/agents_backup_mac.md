# Backup of Mac Computers


To back up data of Mac computers, you can use Veeam Agent for Mac together with Veeam Backup & Replication. In this scenario, some Veeam Agent features differ from the same features in Veeam Agent operating the standalone mode. This section provides description for such features in the Veeam Agent management scenario.

Keep in mind that you must deploy Veeam Agent for Mac on the Mac computer using setup files generated by Veeam Backup & Replication. To learn more, see [Deploying Veeam Agents Using Generated Setup Files](agents_deploy_package.md).
