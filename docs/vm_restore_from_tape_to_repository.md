# Backup Restore from Tape to Repository


This option allows you to copy machine backups from tape to repository. This is helpful if you need some backups on disk for later use, or also for machine guest OS files restore. You can restore full backups or incremental backups to a repository or any location of your choice. The restored backup is registered in the Veeam Backup & Replication console as an imported disk backup so that you can use it for any restore from disk scenario later on. For one restore session at a time, you can choose one restore point available on tape.
