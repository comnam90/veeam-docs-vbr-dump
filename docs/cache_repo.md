# Cache Repositories

In this article

A cache repository is a storage location where Veeam Backup & Replication keeps temporary cached metadata for the data backed up by the file backup jobs and object storage backup jobs. For more information about the cache repository, see the [Backup Infrastructure for Unstructured Data Backup](unstructured_data_backup_infrastructure.md#cache_repository) section.
