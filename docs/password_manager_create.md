# Creating Passwords Using Console


To create a new password in the Password Manager, do the following in the Veeam Backup & Replication console:

1. From the main menu, select Credentials & Passwords > Encryption Passwords.
2. Click Add.
3. In the Hint field, specify a meaningful hint that will help you recall the password. The password hint is displayed when you import an encrypted file on the backup server and access this file.
4. In the Password field, enter a password. To create a strong password, follow the recommendations in the [How Backup Data Encryption Works](encryption_hiw.md) section.

To view the entered password, click and hold the eye icon on the right of the field.

1. Click OK.
