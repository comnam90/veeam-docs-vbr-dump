# YARA Scan for Scan Backup

In this article

For Scan Backup session, you can run a YARA scan to perform the following operations:

* Find the last clean restore point.
* Analyze the content for specific information, for example, sensitive data.

To perform the YARA scan during the Scan Backup session, do the following:

1. In the Scan Backup window, enable the Scan restore points with the following YARA rule option.
2. Place the YARA file with the .yara or .yar extension in the C:\Program Files\Veeam\Backup and Replication\Backup\YaraRules folder (for Veeam Backup & Replication on Microsoft Windows) or in the /var/lib/veeam/yara\_rules/ directory (for Veeam Backup & Replication on Linux). You can add the file through the File view in the Veeam Backup & Replication console. For more information, see [Copying Files and Folders Manually](copying_files_and_folders.md).
