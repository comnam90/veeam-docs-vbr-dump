# Backup Types


Veeam Plug-In uses native IBM Db2 mechanisms to create application-level backups of IBM Db2 data. You can use Veeam Plug-In to create backups of the following types.

* Full backup
* Incremental backup

* Log backup

To create backups of a specific type, you must configure Veeam Plug-In and run the backup process. You can run the backup process manually, immediately after you configure Veeam Plug-In. Alternatively, using third-party schedulers, you can define schedule according to which Veeam Plug-In will back up IBM Db2 data automatically.

For details about IBM Db2 database backup, see [Performing Backup](db2_protection.md).
