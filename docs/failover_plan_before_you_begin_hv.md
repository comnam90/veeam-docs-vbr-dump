# Before You Begin


Before you create a failover plan, check the following prerequisites:

* [If you plan to select VMs from replication jobs] VMs that you plan to include in the failover plan must be successfully replicated at least once.
* [If you plan to select VMs from replication jobs] VM replicas must be in the Ready state.
* If you plan to use pre-failover and post-failover scripts for the failover plan, you must create scripts before you configure the failover plan.
