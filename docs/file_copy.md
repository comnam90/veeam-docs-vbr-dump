# File Copy

In this article

You can copy and move files and folders between servers and hosts added to the backup infrastructure. For file copying operations, Veeam Backup & Replication offers a Windows Explorer-like user interface familiar to a Microsoft Windows user. You can copy files manually or schedule file copy jobs to run automatically by the defined schedule.

The file copy functionality is not intended for creating backups of VM guest OS files. Use backup jobs to create VM image-level backups instead.
