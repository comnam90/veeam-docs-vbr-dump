# Backup Recovery Verification Tests

In this article

To verify machines with a SureBackup job in Full recoverability testing mode, you can instruct Veeam Backup & Replication to run the following backup recovery verification tests:

* [Predefined Tests](predefined_tests_hv.md)
* [Backup File Validation](surebackup_backup_files_valdiation_hv.md)
* [For Veeam Backup & Replication on Windows] [Custom verification scripts](custom_verification_scripts.md)

When running a SureBackup job in Backup verification and content scan only mode, you can only instruct Veeam Backup & Replication to perform backup integrity check.
