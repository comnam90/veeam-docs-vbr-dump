# Creating GFS File and Object Storage to Tape Jobs

In this article

To create a GFS archive on tape, you need to create a [GFS media pool](creating_gfs_media_pools.md) and target a file to tape or object to tape job to it. Technically, a GFS tape job is a variant of a file to tape or object to tape job. When you select a GFS media pool as a target, the job schedule automatically changes to the GFS mode. For details, see [Creating File to Tape Jobs](creating_file_to_tape_jobs.md) and [Creating Object to Tape Jobs](creating_object_to_tape_jobs.md).
