# Data Publishing


With Veeam Backup & Replication, you can publish MongoDB instances from backups that reside on Veeam backup repositories. Publishing a MongoDB instance allows you to temporarily attach the instance to the target MongoDB server without launching restore.

Publish operations are performed on the Veeam Backup & Replication side. For publishing, Veeam Backup & Replication uses the functionality of Veeam Explorer for MongoDB. For details, see [Publishing with Veeam Explorer for MongoDB](mongo_publish.md).
