# Granting Permissions to Users


When you install Veeam Plug-In for Oracle RMAN, full access rights to the plug-in configuration file are automatically granted to all users. To protect sensitive information that is stored in the configuration file from unwanted access, we recommend limiting access to the configuration file to a dedicated group of users.

Depending on the operating system that runs on the machine with installed Veeam Plug-In, you configure access to the plug-in configuration file differently. To learn more, see the following subsections:
