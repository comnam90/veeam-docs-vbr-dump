# Retention of SAP HANA Backups

In this article

In the main scenario, when using Veeam Plug-In for SAP HANA, you must configure the retention policy using native SAP HANA tools. For details, see [Deleting Backups Using SAP HANA Tools](retention_sap_tools.md#studio).

Also, you can manually delete backups from a backup repository using the Veeam Backup & Replication console and enable the force deletion functionality of Veeam Plug-In. For details, see the following sections:

* [Deleting Backups Manually Using Veeam Backup & Replication Console](manual_remove.md)
* [Configuring Force Deletion of Backups](garbage_collector_hana.md)
