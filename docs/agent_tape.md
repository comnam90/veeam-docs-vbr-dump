# Archiving Veeam Agent Backups to Tape


You can configure backup to tape jobs to archive Veeam Agent backups to tape.

Backup to tape jobs treat Veeam Agent backups as usual backup files. The archiving job setup and processing procedures practically do not differ from the regular ones. To learn more about backup to tape jobs, see [Backup to Tape](backup_to_tape_jobs.md).
