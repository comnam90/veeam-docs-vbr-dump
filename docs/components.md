# Backup Infrastructure Components


Veeam Backup & Replication is a modular solution that lets you build a scalable backup infrastructure for environments of different sizes and configuration. The installation package of Veeam Backup & Replication includes a set of components that you can use to configure the backup infrastructure. Some components are mandatory and provide core functionality; some components are optional and can be installed to provide additional functionality for your business and deployment needs.

You can co-install Veeam Backup & Replication components on the same machine, physical or virtual, or set them up separately for a more scalable approach. Components can be deployed using the setup file, Veeam Infrastructure Appliance, or using the Veeam Backup & Replication console.
