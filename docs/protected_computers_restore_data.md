# Restoring Data from Veeam Agent Backups

In this article

You can recover data from Veeam Agent backups created by backup jobs configured in Veeam Backup & Replication. For data restore with the Veeam backup console, you can use the backups created on a Veeam backup repository or cloud repository.

If you specified a local drive or network shared folder as a target for Veeam Agent backups, you need to restore data from such backups using Veeam Agent UI on a protected computer.
