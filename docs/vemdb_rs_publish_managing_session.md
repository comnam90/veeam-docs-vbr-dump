# Managing Publishing Session

In this article

After you finish the steps of the Publish wizard, Veeam Explorer for MongoDB starts a publishing session.

Under the Publish node in the upper part of the navigation pane, you can find the instances with an ongoing or completed publishing process. Click an instance to get a more detailed overview of the publishing process in the preview pane.

Also, in the publishing session view, you can do the following:

* [Restore collections from the published instance](vemdb_rs_published_restore.md).
* [Unpublish the instance](vemdb_rs_unpublishing.md).
