# Performing Backup


After you [configure Veeam Plug-In settings](db2_configure.md), you can use Veeam Plug-In to back up IBM Db2 databases.

Veeam Plug-In backs up IBM Db2 databases according to backup settings that you specify. You can specify what databases to back up, the type of database backups you want to create, and processing settings for backed-up data.
