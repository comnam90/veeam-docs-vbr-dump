# Disk Restore to oVirt KVM

In this article

[This recovery method is available on the Microsoft Windows-based backup server.]

Veeam Backup & Replication allows you to recover different workloads as OLVM and RHV VM disks.

| --- |
| Important |
| To restore to OLVM and RHV, you must install oVirt KVM Plug-In for Veeam Backup & Replication on the backup server. To learn more, see the [Installation](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbrhv/userguide/install_plugin.html?ver=7) section in the Veeam Backup for Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager and Red Hat Virtualization User Guide. |

The restore procedure of virtual disks to oVirt KVM practically does not differ from the procedure described in the [Performing Disk Restore](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbrhv/userguide/restore_disks.html?ver=7) section in the Veeam Backup for OLVM and RHV User Guide.
