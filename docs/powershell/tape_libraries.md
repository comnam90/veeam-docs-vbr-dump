# Tape Libraries

In this article

To add a tape library to Veeam Backup & Replication, you need to connect it to a tape server managed by Veeam Backup & Replication. The libraries connected to a tape server are discovered during rescan.

You can use the cmdlets from this section to perform the following operations with tape libraries:

| Cmdlet | Operation |
| --- | --- |
| [Get-VBRTapeLibrary](get-vbrtapelibrary.md) | Returns tape libraries. |
| [Remove-VBRTapeLibrary](remove-vbrtapelibrary.md) | Removes tape libraries. |
| [Set-VBRTapeLibrary](set-vbrtapelibrary.md) | Modifies tape libraries. |
| [Start-VBRTapeCatalog](start-vbrtapecatalog.md) | Catalogs tape in tape library. |
| [Start-VBRTapeInventory](start-vbrtapeinventory.md) | Inventories tapes in tape library. |
| [Enable-VBRTapeLibraryMaintenance](enable-vbrtapelibrarymaintenance.md) | Enables the Maintenance mode for the tape library or standalone tape drive. |
| [Disable-VBRTapeLibraryMaintenance](disable-vbrtapelibrarymaintenance.md) | Disables the Maintenance mode for the tape library or standalone tape drive. |
