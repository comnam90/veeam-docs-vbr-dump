# Global Changes


In the previous versions, the Veeam PowerShell help files integrated into the product were not updated regularly. Starting from Veeam Backup & Replication 12.1 (build 12.1.0.2131), you can use the Update-Help cmdlet to update in-built help files.

For more information, see [Using Update-Help](update_help.md).
