# Working with Unstructured Data


With Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager, authorized users can perform the following operations with unstructured data (file shares and object storage systems) processed by Veeam Backup & Replication:

* [View unstructured data backups](em_managing_file_shares_view.md)
* [Browse unstructured data backups for specific items](em_managing_file_shares_browse.md)
* [Search unstructured data backups for specific items](unstructured_data_searching_for_items.md)
* [Recover items from backups](em_managing_file_shares_restore.md)
* [Delete backups](em_managing_file_shares_delete.md)

| Note |
| * In the Enterprise Plus edition of Veeam Backup & Replication, users with the Portal Administrator role can customize the restore scope of other users (list of objects the user can recover). In other editions, the restore scope includes all objects and cannot be customized. However, you can delegate recovery of an entire file share, object storage or selected file type. Possible delegation options are described in the [Configuring Permissions for File and Application Item Restore](configuring_restrictions_for_restore.md) section. * Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager does not display objects from the unstructured data to tape backups. |
