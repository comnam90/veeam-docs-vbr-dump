To receive notifications from Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager, you need to specify settings of the server that will send email notifications to necessary email addresses.

You can allow Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager to send email notifications on behalf of your Google or Microsoft 365 account using [OAuth 2.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) authentication, or you can specify connection settings of your SMTP server that use basic (with a password) authentication. You can select from the following options:

* [Connect Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager with a Google account](notifications_gmail.md)
* [Connect Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager with a Microsoft 365 account](notifications_ms365.md)
* [Use an SMTP server with basic authentication](notifications_smtp.md)
