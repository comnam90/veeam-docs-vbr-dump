To start the setup wizard, perform the following steps:

1. Download the latest version of the ISO file from the [Product Downloads](https://my.veeam.com/my-products) section of your Veeam account.
2. Mount the ISO file to the machine where you plan to install Veeam Software Appliance or burn the ISO file to a flash drive or other removable storage device. If you plan to install Veeam Software Appliance on a virtual machine, use the built-in tools of the virtualization management software to mount the ISO file.
