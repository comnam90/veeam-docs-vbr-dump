In this article

You can restore a Microsoft SQL Server database by following one of the following scenarios:

* [Restore to the original location](restore_mssql_1click_restore.md) — to restore a Microsoft SQL Server database to the original location with the same settings.
* [Restore with custom settings](restore_mssql_custom_settings.md) — restore a Microsoft SQL Server database to a new location, or to any location but with different settings.

Before restoring application items, read the [considerations and limitations](em_backup_restore_app_items.md#BeforeYouBegin).
