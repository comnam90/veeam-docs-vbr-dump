In this article

The Destination step of the wizard is available if you restore a VM to a new location or with different settings.

At this step of the wizard, you configure destination settings such as a name of the restored VM, target host, VM folder and resource pool.

1. In the vApp field, specify a vApp to which the VM must be restored. By default, the original vApp is specified. To change the vApp, click Choose.
2. In the Restored VM name field, specify a name under which the VM will be recovered. By default, the original name of the VM is used. If you are restoring the VM to the same vApp where the original VM is registered and the original VM still resides there, change the VM name to avoid conflicts.
