In Veeam Self-Service Backup Portal, members of VMware Cloud Director organizations can perform the following operations:

* On the [Dashboard tab](em_vcd_self_service_stats.md) — view statistics on Cloud Director backups.
* On the [Jobs tab](em_vcd_self_service_manage_jobs.md) — examine and export job sessions data, search for jobs, create new jobs and edit jobs.
* On the [VMs tab](em_vcd_self_service_restore.md) — search by a VM name, restore VMs and vApps to their original location (preserving or overwriting the production VM or vApp), and delete VM backups.
* On the [Files tab](em_vcd_self_service_restore_files.md) — search for the files on the VM guest file system and restore the necessary files to the original location or download to the local machine.
* On the [Items tab](em_vcd_self_service_restore_items.md) — perform application item-level restore (currently, for Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle databases).
