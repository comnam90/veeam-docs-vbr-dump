In this article

You can quickly create a VM restore point using VeeamZIP (full backup) or Quick Backup (incremental backup) right from VMware vSphere Client, with no need to use the Veeam Backup & Replication console. To utilize these capabilities, you need to pair a vCenter Server role of your account with the Portal Administrator or Portal User role of Enterprise Manager. For more information on assigning Enterprise Manager roles, see [Configuring VMware vSphere Roles](configuring_vmware_vsphere_roles.md).
