In this article

With Enterprise Manager you can restore PostgreSQL data at the instance level. To restore a PostgreSQL instance, follow one of the following scenarios:

* [Restore to the original location](restore_postgresql_1click_restore.md) — to restore a PostgreSQL instance to the original location with the same settings.
* [Restore with custom settings](restore_postgresql_custom_settings.md) — restore a PostgreSQL instance to a new location, or to any location but with different settings.

Before restoring application items, read the [considerations and limitations](em_backup_restore_app_items.md#BeforeYouBegin).
