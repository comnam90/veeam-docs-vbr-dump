If you are a Service Provider that have a Rental license installed in Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager, you must monthly submit a license usage report from Enterprise Manager.

Veeam offers two methods of usage reporting: automatic and manual. The automatic reporting is used if [automatic license update](em_license_update.md) is enabled. For more information about how license usage reporting works, see the [License Usage Reporting](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/cloud/sp_license_usage_report.html?ver=13) section of the Veeam Cloud Connect Guide.

Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager generates a monthly usage report on the first day of the month. The report is based on the number of instances used for backup and replication in the previous month.
