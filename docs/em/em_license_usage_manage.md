In this article

If you are a Service Provider that has a Rental license installed in Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager, you must submit a monthly license usage report.

You can submit a license usage report directly from Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager or from the VCSP Pulse Portal. Submitting a usage report from Enterprise Manager is only possible if [automatic license update](em_license_update.md) is enabled. Otherwise, you must fill out and submit the report in the VCSP Pulse Portal.

For more information about how license usage reporting works, see the [License Usage Reporting](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/cloud/sp_license_usage_report.html?ver=13) section of the Veeam Cloud Connect Guide.

Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager generates a monthly usage report on the first day of the month. The report is based on the number of instances used for backup and replication in the previous month.
