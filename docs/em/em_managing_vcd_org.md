# Managing Configurations for Cloud Director Organizations


In Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager, users with the Portal Administrator role can manage configurations for VMware Cloud Director organizations. Each configuration defines a backup repository that can be used by the organization, repository quota and backup job settings. To specify multiple repositories per organization, add a separate configuration for each repository.

Before you manage Cloud Director organization configurations, [check prerequisites](em_vcd_before_you_begin.md).

You can perform the following operations with Cloud Director organizations:

* [View the list of organization configurations](em_vcd_view_org_configurations.md)
* [Add a new configuration for a Cloud Director organization](em_configure_vcd_org.md)
* [Edit a Cloud Director organization configuration](em_modifying_vcd_org_settings.md)
* [Remove a Cloud Director organization configuration](em_remove_custom_vcd_settings.md)
* [Export a configuration report](em_vcd_export_configuration_report.md)
