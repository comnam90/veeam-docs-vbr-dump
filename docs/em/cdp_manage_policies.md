Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager allows you to manage CDP policies that were previously created on added backup servers. Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager displays CDP policies that process VMware vSphere or VMware Cloud Director objects.

Users with the Portal Administrator role can view, disable and enable, edit and delete CDP policies. Users with the Portal User role can only view CDP policies.

For more information on CDP, see the [Continuous Data Protection (CDP)](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/userguide/cdp_replication.html?ver=13) section of the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide.
