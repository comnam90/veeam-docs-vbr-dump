After you locate the necessary file, you can use Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager to restore it from the backup. You can choose to restore a file to the original location or download it to the local machine.

Restore operations are only available to authorized users according to their security settings. Users with the Portal Administrator role can both restore files to the original location or download them to the local machine.

For users with the non-administrative roles, you can configure additional restriction settings. For example, you can prohibit restore operators to download files to the local machine so that they will be able to restore files to the original location only. Additionally, you can specify the types of files that can be restored by operators (this can be helpful if you want to limit operators’ access to sensitive data). For details, see [Configuring Permissions for File and Application Item Restore](configuring_restrictions_for_restore.md).
