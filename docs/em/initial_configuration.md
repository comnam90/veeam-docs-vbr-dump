To start working with Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager, perform the following steps:

1. Log in to the Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager website. For more information, see [Accessing Enterprise Manager](accessing_management_website.md).
2. Add backup servers you want to manage. For more information, see [Adding Backup Servers](adding_backup_server.md).
3. Retrieve data from added backup servers. For more information, see [Collecting Data from Backup Servers](collecting_data_from_backup_servers.md).
4. Assign the Portal Administrator, Restore Operator or Portal User roles to users who will work with Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager. For more information, see [Configuring Accounts and Roles](veeam_backup_em_roles.md).
5. Provide email notification settings to be able to receive emails with summary on performed backup and replication jobs, lab request status changes and file restore operations. For more information, see [Configuring Notification Settings](configuring_notification_settings.md).

Once you have performed initial configuration, you can start working with managed backup servers. You can change the necessary settings in the Configuration view at any time.
