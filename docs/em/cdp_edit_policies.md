# Editing Policies


If Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager has an Enterprise or Enterprise Plus license installed, users with the Portal Administrator role can modify settings of CDP policies that have been previously configured on added backup servers . In Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager, you can change only a subset of the CDP policy settings. You can configure other policy settings with the Veeam Backup & Replication console only.

You can edit the following CDP policy settings:

* Policy name and description
* List of VMs that the policy processes
* Policy schedule
* Guest processing settings

To edit a CDP policy, use the Edit Policy wizard.

1. [Launch the Edit Policy wizard](cdp_launch_wizard.md).
2. [Edit the policy name and description](cdp_edit_name.md).
3. [Edit the list of VMs](cdp_edit_list_of_vms.md).
4. [Configure RPO and retention settings](jobs_edit_schedule.md).
5. [Configure guest processing settings](cdp_configure_guest_processing_settings.md).
