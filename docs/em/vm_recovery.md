Authorized users can recover VMs from backups to the original location or a new location included in their restore scope. Users with the Portal Administrator role have no scope limitations. For more information on restore scope, see [Configuring Restore Scope](veeam_backup_em_restore_scope.md).

With Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager, you can perform the following types of recovery:

* [Instant Recovery](instant_recovery.md)
* [Entire VM Restore](entire_vm_restore.md)
* [Virtual Disk Restore](em_disk_restore.md)

* [VM Failover](em_performing_failover.md)
* [Failover Plans](em_failover.md)
