At the Virtual Machines step of the wizard, you can change the VM processing order. It can be helpful if specific VMs must be processed first, if you want to ensure that processing of a MV does not overlap with other scheduled activities, or that VM processing is completed before the certain time.

To change the VM processing order, select the necessary machines and move them up or down the list using the Up and Down buttons on the right. In the same manner, you can set the backup order for containers in the backup list. You can change the order of the following VMware Cloud Director objects: VMs, vApps, organization VDCs, organizations and the Cloud Director instance. The scope depends on your Cloud Director access rights.
