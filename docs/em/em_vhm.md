# Host Management


If you use Enterprise Manager on Linux, you can manage host configurations using the Veeam Host Management console. The console allows administrators to perform configuration and maintenance tasks, including managing network settings, server time, host users and roles, backup infrastructure, OS and Enterprise Manager updates, maintenance operations, and security settings.
