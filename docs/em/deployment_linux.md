# Veeam Software Appliance Installation


To start working with Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager on Linux, you must deploy an Enterprise Manager server — install Veeam Software Appliance on a machine that meets the system requirements. To do this, you can use the ISO or OVA file.

After you install Veeam Software Appliance, you can access the Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager website. For details, see [Accessing Enterprise Manager](accessing_management_website.md).
