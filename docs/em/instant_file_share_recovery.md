When you perform instant file share recovery using Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager, Veeam Backup & Replication publishes the recovered file share to the mount server associated with a backup repository that stores the file share backup. If you want to mount a recovered file share to another mount server, use the Veeam Backup & Replication console. For more information, see the [Performing Instant File Share Recovery](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/userguide/performing_instant_file_share_recovery.html?ver=13) section of the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide.

1. [Launch the Instant File Share Recovery wizard](instant_nas_recovery_launch.md).
2. [Select a restore point](instant_nas_recovery_file_shares.md).
3. [Specify access permissions](instant_nas_recovery_access_permissions.md).
