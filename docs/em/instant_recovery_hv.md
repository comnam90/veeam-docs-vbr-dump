# Instant Recovery to Microsoft Hyper-V


Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager allows you to instantly recover Microsoft Hyper-V VMs to Microsoft Hyper-V. You can recover VMs from backups to the original location or a new location included in your restore scope. After you have performed Instant Recovery, you have to finalize it. For more information, see [Finalizing Instant Recovery to Microsoft Hyper-V](instant_recovery_hv_finalize.md).
