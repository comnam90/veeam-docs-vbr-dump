To restore an Oracle database, follow one of the following scenarios:

* [Restore to the original location](restore_oracle_1click_restore.md) — to restore an Oracle instance to the original location with the same settings.
* [Restore with custom settings](restore_oracle_custom_settings.md) — restore an Oracle instance to a new location, or to any location but with different settings.

Before restoring application items, read the [considerations and limitations](em_backup_restore_app_items.md#BeforeYouBegin).
