# Configuring Notification Settings


Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager allows you to receive email notifications on job results, restore operations and so on.

Before you configure notification settings, specify the settings of the server that will send email notifications to necessary email addresses. For more information, see [Mail Server Settings](mail_server_settings.md).

After that, you can fine tune necessary notifications:

* [Notifications on job results](em_notifications_on_job_results.md)
* [Notifications on restore operations](em_notifications_on_rest_ops.md)
* [Notifications on licensing](em_notifications_on_license.md)
* [Notifications on encryption keys operations](em_notifications_on_key_mgt.md)
