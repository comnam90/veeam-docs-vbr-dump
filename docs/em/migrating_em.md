You may need to migrate Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager or its configuration database, or both to another server.

Before you migrate Enterprise Manager, you must export Enterprise Manager keysets and prepare the credentials stored in the Enterprise Manager configuration database so you will be able to re-enter the credentials on a new server. If you migrate the Enterprise Manager configuration database only, the credentials and keysets will remain valid.

For more information on migration scenarios, see [this Veeam KB article](https://www.veeam.com/kb1889).
