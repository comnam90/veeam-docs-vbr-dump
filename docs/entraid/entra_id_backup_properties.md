You can restore the logs from any of these points. To learn how to restore the log data, see [Entra ID Log Restore](entra_id_log_restore.md).

To view summary information for backups:

2. In the inventory pane, select Backups.
3. In the working area, right-click the log backup and select Properties.
4. To see the list of available restore points, select the required tenant from the Objects list.
