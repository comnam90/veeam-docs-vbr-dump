| If you want Veeam Backup & Replication to prioritize the log backup job over other jobs and to allocate backup infrastructure resources to this job first, select the High priority check box. For more information on job priorities, see the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide, section [Getting Started](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/userguide/job_priorities.html?ver=13). |
