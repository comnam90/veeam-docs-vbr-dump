# Managing Backup Jobs


To view all jobs configured on the backup server, open the Home view and select the Jobs node in the inventory pane. The list of available jobs is displayed in the working area. You can start and stop jobs, retry failed jobs, edit job properties, clone jobs, view job statistics and delete unnecessary jobs.
