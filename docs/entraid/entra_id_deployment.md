# Deployment


The Veeam Backup & Replication solution allows you to add Microsoft Entra ID tenants to the backup infrastructure, and to manage data protection and recovery operations for Microsoft Entra ID tenants from a single console.

To access the Veeam Backup for Microsoft Entra ID functionality, you can either deploy a new backup server as described in the [Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/userguide/install_vbr.html?ver=13) or use a backup server that already exists in your backup infrastructure if it meets the [Veeam Backup for Microsoft Entra ID system requirements](entra_id_sys_req.md).
